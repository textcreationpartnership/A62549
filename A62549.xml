            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a matter of <hi>Lamentation</hi> to thoſe who are left behinde, that ſo many <hi>Sons of Sion</hi> are tranſplanted to eternity, whoſe <hi>Counſels, Praiers, Experiences</hi> — might have been very uſeful (if the Lord had ſeen it good to continue them on earth) towards the directing, helping, and comforting, may weak, doubting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent ſouls in their journey towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And amongſt others in our day, the death of that <hi>gracious;</hi> and <hi>ſweet-ſpirited man,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tillinghaſt,</hi> deſerveth much to bee <hi>lamented.</hi> But there it matter of <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> in the midſt of our <hi>mourning</hi> for the Saints; in that, <hi>death</hi> bringeth them to the <hi>poſſeſſion of thoſe Promiſes,</hi> which before they were but heirs under age unto. As Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>John 14.28. If yee loved mee, yee would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go unto the Father, for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than I.</hi> So, if wee rightly
<pb facs="tcp:93048:3"/>loved the Saints, wee would <hi>rejoice</hi> when they go unto the <hi>Father,</hi> for then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>End</hi> of their Faith, and then they <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> object of their hope, even <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is our great mercy, who ſtill remain, that although the Author of the enſuing Treatiſes, was plucked away like a bloſſome in the prime, yet hee hath left us ſo many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtructions about the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> the <hi>life of Faith,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> &amp;c. that it may bee ſaid of him, by theſe, <hi>hee being dead, yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Wee forfeited all our mercies in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by ſin, and could never have attained unto grounded hopes of grace, or glory; if the Lord had not vouchſafed to enter into Covenant with us, in, and for the ſake of Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> But now there <hi>are given unto all that are in Chriſt, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>1.4. exceeding great and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that by theſe they might bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Divine nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Promiſes</hi> are divine <hi>Engagements,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as with reverence wee may ſpeak it) the Lord doth pawn his own faithfulneſſe for a ſecurity to our ſaith and hope.</p>
            <p>Oh what matter of admiration is here! that the God of glory ſhould condeſcend ſo far as to come under <hi>Engagements</hi> to poor, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb facs="tcp:93048:3"/>and unworthy creatures? and ſtill there is more matter of aſtoniſhment, if it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what <hi>glorious things</hi> are put under <hi>Promiſe</hi> to the Saints, even <hi>God himſelf,</hi> Heb. <hi>8.10. This is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe daies, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their minde, and write them in their hearts, and I will bee to them a God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtian, what wouldeſt thou have more? is not God thy all in all? is there not enough in God to anſwer all thy deſires, to ſatisfy all thy longings, to ſupply all thy wants? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou hast him in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> hee hath made over <hi>himſelf</hi> to thee in the way of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> hee hath <hi>engaged himſelf</hi> to bee thy God. If the Lord had promiſed only earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injoyments, health, wealth, though it had been in great abundance, and mountains of gold, and heaps of Pearls, &amp;c. yet it had been nothing in compariſon of this, to ſay, <hi>I will bee thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou art rich indeed, who art in Chriſt, all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are thine, and ſo God thine, and therefore all thine. Thou mayeſt in all ſtraits, exigencies and neceſsities, go to God in the way of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> that thou
<pb facs="tcp:93048:4"/>ſtandeſt really in need of the uſe of, for they are all <hi>engaged</hi> for thy advantage. When Satan uſeth his policy againſt thee, then thou mayeſt ſay, Lord, thou haſt <hi>promiſed</hi> to bee my God, and ſo thy <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is <hi>engaged</hi> for mee; O! let mee finde that improved, for the defeating my ſubtil enemy in his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</p>
            <p>When thou art aſſaulted with ſtrong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which thou art no way able to withſtand, or haſte ſome great difficulty in the way to hinder thee in comming up to any duty, or to obſtruct thee in the exerciſe of any grace, as faith, patience, humility, &amp;c. Then thou mayeſt ſay, Lord, thou haſt <hi>promiſed</hi> to bee my God, and ſo thy <hi>Power</hi> is mine. O now let it bee improved for my help and aſsiſtance againſt theſe difficulties which are too ſtrong for mee to overcome: and ſo for all other <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi> of God, thou mayeſt in all times of need claim an intereſt in, and by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> plead a laying of them out for thy good.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded that many of the fears, doubts, diſquiets, &amp;c. of many Chriſtians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their eternal conditions, and their great diſtances from aſſurance, take their riſe hence, becauſe they do not clearly underſtand, or are not throughly perſwaded, that the way of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:93048:4"/>making over himſelf unto ſouls, is the way of a <hi>Promiſe;</hi> that a <hi>Covenant</hi> is that whereby the Lord giveth us hold of himſelf in this life, and whereby hee giveth us aſſurance of all the bleſſings which are to bee injoyed in another, and a better life. Were they hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and explicitly convinced, that the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God which they are to look for here, muſt bee by Faith, and ſo through the glaſſe of a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> then they might finde that they have had many ſuch injoyments of God, which they have overlooked.</p>
            <p>The great temptation of this age is, to look more to a life of ſenſe and feeling, than to a life of Faith, to look more to a Christ within, than (in the way of a <hi>Promiſe</hi>) to a Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Many will own none as injoyments of God, but inward feeling of ſupports, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, enlargements, conſolations, &amp;c. It is no longer than they injoy theſe, that they think they injoy God; whereas they ought to let out their hearts in the way of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to God, through Chriſt for ſuch mercies, when they are under the deepeſt ſenſe of the want of them; and there are as real injoyments of God in ſuch out-goings of the heart to God, as in thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible incommings of joy and comfort, &amp;c. For, the <hi>life of Faith</hi> conſiſteth in ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going of the whole heart in the way of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93048:5"/>Chriſt-ward; hence Faith is called a comming to Chriſt, <hi>John 6.35. Hee that [commeth to mee] ſhall never hunger;</hi> this is expreſſed by beleeving in the latter end of the verſe <hi>[hee that beleeveth on mee ſhall never thirſt.]</hi> So that Faith is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole heart Chriſt-ward; Faith doth not conſiſt ſo properly in beleeving that Chriſt is thine, or that thy ſin is pardoned — as, in the letting out thy heart to Chriſt in the way of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> for his righteouſneſs, and the remiſsion of thy ſin, &amp;c. And if this were duly conſidered, ſouls would never in their loweſt, ſaddeſt, and moſt deſerted conditions, bee ſhy of beleeving; for who can queſtion at any time whether they may thus let out their hearts to Chriſt, or no? and yet the doing this, is beleeving, yea the propereſt act of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſeth therein; and if at any time a ſoul bee inabled by grace to this, then it hath a ſweet injoyment of God and Chriſt in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> though ſenſible quickenings, &amp;c. bee wanting, for no act of Faith can bee without an injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
            <p>If thou bee'ſt inabled with thy whole heart, to take hold of Gods <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c. in a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> thou deſt as really injoy God, ſo long as thy ſoul ſticketh cloſe to him there, whileſt the ſenſible improvements of
<pb facs="tcp:93048:5"/>thoſe divine <hi>Artributes,</hi> ars denyed thee, as thou doſt afterward, when theſe are granted. And the ſame may bee ſaid for any <hi>promiſed</hi> Mercy, if the heart bee throughly drawn out Chriſt-ward in the way of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> for it, in its proper ſeaſon, as when that mercy is ſutable to the preſent condition, &amp;c. there is as real an injoyment of God in ſuch a waiting for it, as in the after fruition of it; for there is the <hi>life of Faith</hi> before it is afforded, and Faith cannot be without a fruition of God. The Proper time of <hi>Abrahams</hi> acting Faith for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> was before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was given, <hi>Rom. 4.19. And being nor weak in Faith, he conſidered not his own body, now dead</hi> — verſ. <hi>20. Hee ſtaggered not at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, through unbeleef, but was ſtrong in Faith,</hi> — So that injoyments of God by Faith, may be as well before, as when a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi> mercy is afforded. I do not ſpeak againſt looking for ſenſible feelings of Chriſts preſence within, in enlargements, and quickenings, &amp;c. but againſt judging theſe the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of God, and againſt looking more for theſe, than for out-goings of heart to Chriſt by Faith; whereas the beſt way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more of theſe, is to act Faith on the Chriſt of God, who is without us, in the way of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> for them. The Lord would take care of
<pb facs="tcp:93048:6"/>Chriſtians comforts, if they were more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to own his faithfulneſſe in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you would bee ſucceſsful in any of your dealings with the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> then bee ſure that your ſouls do claſp hold of Chriſt therewith, <hi>for all the Promiſes in him are yea, and in him Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing the <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> of God is <hi>ingaged</hi> for the accompliſhment of all <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Oh what ſweet incouragement doth this afford, to <hi>exerciſe hope</hi> on him, for all thoſe mercies which are <hi>promiſed,</hi> and which wee are yet without!</p>
            <p>Chriſtians are exceedingly backward to the exerciſe of this grace of <hi>Hope,</hi> which might bee of admirable uſe to them; and moſt averſe to exerciſe it about eternal life, which is the higheſt and chiefeſt object of it.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>hope,</hi> not only for temporal, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for ſpiritual mercies; neceſſary in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they are exerciſed in, as under dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, they <hi>hope</hi> for quickenings; under ſtreightnings, they <hi>hope</hi> for inlargements; under witherings, they <hi>hope</hi> for flouriſhings of grace; but where is the ſoul that is <hi>hoping</hi> for the glory of God? <hi>Rom. 5.2.</hi> A <hi>hoping</hi> for Heaven, and the life to come? it is the caſting <hi>hope within the vail</hi> that rendreth it
<pb facs="tcp:93048:6"/>of uſe as a <hi>Soul-anchor,</hi> that ſecureth againſt the ſtorms of affliction, and temptation which are met withall in this World.</p>
            <p>A great reaſon of the ſinking of many under theſe, is, becauſe they caſt away their <hi>anchor</hi> (the <hi>hope</hi> of eternal life) when the tempeſt riſeth higheſt, and when they have moſt need of it. It is very ſad to obſerve, that carnal men are ſo high in their <hi>Hopes</hi> for heaven, who have no grounds for <hi>hoping;</hi> and on the other hand, that Chriſtians are ſo low in their <hi>hopes,</hi> who have ſuch firm grounds for them.</p>
            <p>There is <hi>1 A hope of deſire. 2 A hope of Aſſurance,</hi> or Confidence.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, you may ſometimes bee under ſuch doubts, and queſtionings about your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as you may not be able to conclude with a <hi>hope</hi> of confidence, and <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> that you ſhall injoy God to all eternity.</p>
            <p>But a <hi>Hope of Deſire</hi> after the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God as the chiefeſt good, as recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nothing ſuch a matter of <hi>Hope,</hi> as a full fruition of him, and Jeſus Chriſt to all eternity, this <hi>Hope of Deſire</hi> under the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt deſertion you may keep up, and ſinne if you do not, <hi>Cant 3. v. 1, 2. Cant. 5.6.</hi> The Spouſe ſought her beloved, when hee had withdrawn himſelf. As under the hidings of Chriſts face, the ſaints may have a <hi>Hope
<pb facs="tcp:93048:7"/>of Deſire</hi> to ſee his face again on earth, ſo as well may they then long to ſee him face to face in heaven.</p>
            <p>The Saints ſhould ſay, when will the bridge-groom of our ſouls come? when ſhall wee have full fellowſhip with him? when ſhall wee have full imbraces in his armes? when ſhall wee injoy the <hi>Promiſed</hi> everlaſting reſt? when ſhall we have a full freedome from all ſinne, and ſuffering? thus <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>Hope of Deſire</hi> to bee diſsolved that hee might be with Chriſt, <hi>Phil. 1.23.</hi> and <hi>Rom. 8.23. wee groan within our ſelves;</hi> that implyeth a wearineſs of the preſent Condition, but the inducement was the <hi>hope</hi> of Glory; <hi>(waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body)</hi> but where is the ſoul that is under a wearineſſe of its preſent Condition, not barely to be freed from burdens and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, but out of a want of heavenly glory, and a full communion with Jeſus Chriſt, O Chriſtians! you can never want a ground thus to hope, and therefore put on your <hi>Helmet,</hi> the <hi>Hope of Salvation,</hi> caſt forth the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> and that <hi>within the Vail,</hi> that your Lord may finde you looking for the <hi>bleſſed Hope</hi> of his coming.</p>
            <p>We ſhall add no more but this, that the Lord, graciouſly granted us the priviledge to be ear
<pb facs="tcp:93048:7"/>witneſſes, that diverſe of the Sermons in theſe Treatiſes, for the ſubſtance of them (giving allowance to ſuch defects of the Emanuenſis, which cannot but bee expected ordinarily) were Preached by that Servant of Chriſt Mr. <hi>Tillinghaſt,</hi> and others are, as they were found in his own hand-writing; Some Sermons are wanting, but could not be gained; yet theſe being ſo uſeful, we were unwilling the World ſhould be without them; ſo deſiring that the bleſſing of Chriſt may accompany theſe labors, We remain</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93048:15"/>being ſo and ſo qualified: Now all theſe promiſes as well as the other that are abſolute, are made to ſinners <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> who is as I may ſo ſay, the firſt qualified perſon. For, look as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> being a publick perſon, and the common ſtock, and root of all mankind, did by his fall or diſobedience, draw all the threatnings of the juſt and holy Law of God upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firſt, and then by way of natural convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance did derive them unto all his poſterity after him, becauſe ſtanding for them as a common perſon in their room, and they coming forth of his loyns; Even ſo in like manner, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was, and the ſtock or root of all his ſeed, hee by ſtanding and fulfilling the Law of God (which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brake) did draw all the good things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed therein unto himſelf firſt, and then by way of ſpiritual and ſupernatural conveyance, derives them unto all thoſe which are his ſeed. So that there is not one promiſe of the Law of God, but it centers it ſelf, as I may ſo ſay, in Jeſus Chriſt, who hath fulfilled this Law of God, and from him is given forth both that grace to which the promiſe is made, and alſo that good thing whatſoever it bee, which is promiſed to that grace.</p>
               <p>By this in the general, wee may ſee how that <hi>all the promiſes of God, whether thoſe that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, or whether ſuch as are conditional, they do all run in Chriſt, and are made to us in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus in general cleared up this truth, I ſhall come now more particularly to ſhew you,</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93048:16"/>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>The truth of this,</hi> that it is ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Some <hi>reaſons why</hi> it is ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Shall <hi>apply</hi> it.</p>
               <p>In order to the clearing of the thing that <hi>it is ſo,</hi> I ſhall premiſe this, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe ſeveral promiſes of grace, glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> good things here and hereafter, which the Father hath made to Chriſt, they are not made to him for himſelf, he in this reſpect having no need of them, or that the Father ſhould make promiſes of ſuch things to him, he having a proper right in, and unto all theſe things, by vertue of his co-equallity with the Father, yea injoying and poſſeſſing of them; and therefore hath no need in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that theſe things ſhould bee given to him by promiſe, which are his by proper right, but they are made to him reſpectively, as hee is our Surety, and common perſon, occupying our room, and ſtanding in our ſtead, who of our ſelves, had no right to any of theſe things, no nor Chriſt neither, though hee had a perſonal right as co-eternal, and co-equal with the Father, yet as hee ſtood for us, and in our ſtead, had no right but what hee hath by promiſe.</p>
               <p>Now then, if this can bee cleared, that all the promiſes of God are made to Chriſt, taking this for granted which wee have premiſed, and which in it ſelf is alſo clear, that they are made to Chriſt not for himſelf, who had no need to have theſe things given to him by promiſe; but for us, whoſe Surety hee is, and common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then will the reſult bee clearly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently what wee have laid downe and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>That all the promiſes of God made unto us, are made unto us in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thing therefore to bee cleared is, That all the promiſes <hi>are made to Chriſt,</hi> which being cleared, the other follows, That they <hi>are made to us in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To clear this, I ſhall begin with the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that ever was made to mankinde ſince the fall, <hi>viz.</hi> That promiſe made to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3.15. which as it is the firſt promiſe which ever fallen man heard of, ſo it is the grand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (as I may ſo ſay) that upon which all the other promiſes hang, and have their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and therefore look how this promiſe runs, to whom this is made, wee may conclude (this being the grand leading Promiſe) that all the other go in the ſame way, run to the ſame perſon.</p>
               <p>Now if you read the words, you ſhall ſee it clear, that the promiſe is primarily made, not to <hi>Adam</hi> but to the <hi>Seed of the woman,</hi> i.e. <hi>Chriſt, The Seed of the woman ſhall</hi> — God doth not make a promiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> that hee ſhall <hi>break the Serpents head;</hi> but the promiſe runs firſt to <hi>the Seed of the Woman,</hi> that is Chriſt, that hee ſhould do it, and to <hi>Adam</hi> through the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> i.e. <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, if wee come downward to <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and look to the renewal of the promiſe with him, wee ſhall finde that it ſtill runs to Chriſt, and is made to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. The promiſe is made to <hi>Abrahams Seed,</hi> now that is expreſly meant of Chriſt, as appears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93048:17"/>
               <p>Yea further, this is clear from the Levitical types and ſhadows, which as they were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, ſo may I ſay, they were promiſes of good things to come, repreſenting things to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eye, as done already, and injoyed already. Now what did they all point out to us, but onely Chriſt?</p>
               <p>All the Sacrifices, Oblation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Law did point out Chriſt, and did all center in him the great Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Onely there is this difference betwixt Types and Promiſes, the Type is terminated, and hath its end in the Antitype, ſo ſoon as the thing ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified or ſhadowed cometh, the type or ſhadow, ceaſeth any longer to bee; but not ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for although the good thing promiſed bee performed, yet the promiſe remains ſtill, ſo that in caſe a poor creature have had ſuch a mercy, and loſt it again, yet hee may go to the Promiſe again and again for it.</p>
               <p>I might further illuſtrate this from ſome Titles given to Chriſt in Scripture, as of a <hi>Husband,</hi> an <hi>Heir,</hi> hee is <hi>the Heir of all things,</hi> therefore made to him as the primary Heir, therefore all come by a Mediator, Chriſt is the <hi>Way,</hi> therefore no coming down of promiſes but in Chriſt; but I paſs this over.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe <hi>God would hereby convince the creature that the is faln.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and mercies, did immediately come from God to man without the intervening of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or middle perſon; but now man being fallen, God will not make him ſo much as one promiſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93048:17"/>of a mercy, nor beſtow one mercy upon him, but through another; that ſo the creature may come to ſee that he is fallen from his firſt ſtation, and is not now in that ſtation that once hee was.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>God would hereby convince the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that abſolute neceſſity that he hath of Chriſt, and cloſing with Chriſt:</hi> Why? Becauſe all the promiſes are made in Chriſt, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome cloſe with Chriſt, the creature cannot aſſure himſelf of any of thoſe good things held forth in the promiſe to be his. Thou canſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a promiſe without a Chriſt, a promiſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy without a Chriſt, no ſpecial, ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but promiſed to Chriſt. So that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity doth hereby appear, though thou mighteſt attain much of morality, yet thou canſt not hence attain to intereſt in any peculiar promiſe without Chriſt. So that if thou haſt not Chriſt, thou canſt not call God Father, nor canſt not ſay thy ſins are forgiven, <hi>As many as received him, to them hee gave power to bee called the Sons of God,</hi> Job. 1.12. <hi>In whom wee have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Eph. 1.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>God would have us to pitch our faith upon the perſon of his Son, and not barely upon the promiſe;</hi> and therefore hee hath ſo ordered things in his divine wiſdome, that the promiſes ſhould all hold on Chriſt, and bee <hi>Yea and Amen</hi> in him. Had God made promiſes to ſouls, and theſe promiſes not made to them in Chriſt, wee ſhould ſit down and take up our reſt ſhort of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, we ſhould pitch upon the promiſe, and reſt there, never looking any further, nor ſo much as once eying Chriſt himſelf; but now God hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93048:18"/>linked all his Promiſes to his Son, yea ſtored them up in him, that ſo our faith might look further than to the bare Promiſe, to the perſon of Chriſt, in whom all theſe Promiſes are, and ſo take up our reſt in Chriſt himſelf, not in the Promiſe. Hence Chriſt himſelf is the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, God firſt promiſeth him, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſes are ours by vertue of our right to, and intereſt in him firſt. All good things are given, firſt by giving Chriſt; there is a Chriſt firſt, and entertaining of that Chriſt, <hi>how ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.32. As to inſtance in the Promiſes God hath made of pardon and forgiveneſs, theſe Promiſes are not (as one ſaith) as the pardons of a Prince, which meerly contain an expreſſion of his Royal word for pardoning, ſo as we in ſeeking of it doe reſt upon, and have to doe only with his Word and Seal, which we have to ſhew for it; but Gods promiſes of pardon are made in his Son, and are as if a Prince ſhould offer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to a Traytor upon Marriage with his Childe, whom in and with that pardon he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in ſuch a relation; ſo as all that would have pardon muſt firſt ſeek out for his Childe. So we, would we have pardon, we muſt firſt look out to Gods Son, whom hee freely offers in Marriage to us firſt, and ſo then after ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of Marriage between Chriſt and our Souls, the promiſes of forgiveneſs, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes are ours; for having firſt a right to the Perſon of him who is <hi>ſole Heir</hi> of the Promiſes, we have a right to, and an intereſt in all thoſe Promiſes he is Heir of.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93048:18"/>
               <p>As when a man Marries a Woman, his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to her gives him a right and title to all her eſtate; ſo our Marriage to Chriſt himſelf, is that which gives us right and title to all thoſe precious Promiſes that are in him, and all the good things promiſed in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Therefore hath God made all his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Chriſt, <hi>that ſo the Perſon of his Son might be in more eſteeme with us.</hi> Hence it follows, that a ſoul married and united to Chriſt, hath by vertue of this Marriage-union, and the relation he ſtands in to Chriſt, a right and title to every Promiſe in the Book of God, and hee may boldly go and lay claime to the ſame, as his own and proper right, by vertue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he hath in Chriſt as a Husband, in whom are all the Promiſes. If he meet with a promiſe of <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin,</hi> as that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. he may go to it, and lay claime to it, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it as his, and ſay, the Promiſe of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins it is mine, it belongeth to me, my ſins are done away, for it is in Chriſt and I have choſen him for my Husband. If he meet with a promiſe of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27. he may challenge it as his, and ſay, this is mine, and I ſhall be Satisfied, God will give me a new heart, &amp;c. So if he meet with a promiſe of <hi>Teaching,</hi> as that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>But the comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things.</hi> So when he meets with a promiſe of <hi>ſtrengthening and ſupporting grace,</hi> in a day of temptation, hee may lay claime to it, as that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 9. <hi>My grace in ſufficient for thee.</hi> So
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93048:19"/>when he meets with a promiſe of having <hi>ſinne mortified</hi> in him, as that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> So when hee meets with a promiſe of <hi>life and quickning,</hi> as that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Becauſe I live, yee ſhall live alſo.</hi> Of <hi>Fruitfulneſs,</hi> as that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.14. <hi>They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age, they ſhall bee fat and flouriſhing.</hi> So when he meets with a promiſe of <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> as that, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me.</hi> So, when with a promiſe of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his <hi>Prayers anſwered,</hi> as we have many, he may challenge it. Thus a ſoul married to Chriſt, can come and challenge, lay claime to every Promiſe, as a Wife can challenge the Goods of her Husband as hers, ſhe having a proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them, which another Woman who doth not ſtand in ſuch a relation to ſuch a perſon cannot.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Becauſe <hi>God would have his Son Chriſt to be all in all;</hi> Gods deſign is to advance his Son, and make him all in all, not only in himſelf, but to us, that we might look upon him as all in all, and account him our <hi>all in all;</hi> and therefore all the Promiſes God hath made to us, are made unto us in him, ſo as that whatſoever we ſeek for, we might finde it in Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him (as he is) <hi>all in all.</hi> Therefore all the promiſes of our Juſtification, pardon of Sin, &amp;c. are in him, that Chriſt might be <hi>all in all</hi> in that. The promiſes of the giving of grace are <hi>all</hi> in him, that Chriſt might be <hi>all in all</hi> in that. The promiſes of encreaſing of Grace in him, that Chriſt might bee <hi>all in all</hi> in that.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93048:19"/>The promiſes of acceptance of our duties in him, that hee might bee <hi>all in all</hi> in that. The promiſes of aſſiſtance to, and in duty in him, that he might be <hi>all in all</hi> in that. The promiſes of Perſeverance here, of Glory hereafter, are <hi>all</hi> in him, that Chriſt might bee <hi>all in all,</hi> both in reſpect of our being kept here, and bleſſed hereafter. If the promiſes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies wee receive were made out of Chriſt, wee ſhould look on Mercies, and not acknowledge our ſelves beholding to Chriſt. If wee have peace, it is from him; comfort, it is from him; it wiſdome, it is from him; if light, it is from him, who is the Light of the World, that wee might acknowledge Chriſt in all.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Becauſe <hi>God would make his Promiſes ſo, as that his Children might not he deprived of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them.</hi> God once made a promiſe to man in himſelf, and hee loſt it, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the good and benefit of it. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever ſince will have his Promiſes run in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and a ſurer Channel, that ſo his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may not deprive themſelves, or be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the benefit of them; and therefore the Apoſtle in the Text ſaith, That <hi>all the Promiſes of God, are yea, and Amen,</hi> i. e, true, faithful, immutable, ſhall be fulfilled, and that upon this very account of their being in Chriſt; <hi>in him they are yea, in him, Amen;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, There could bee no certainty of the Promiſes were they not <hi>in him. Adam</hi> once had promiſes for himſelf and his Seed and of loſt them, but the Promiſes are in him, and therefore upon this account they are true and faithful ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comphiſhed;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93048:20"/>the Heirs of Promiſe ſhall not fail, or come ſhort of the things promiſed to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Are theſe things ſo, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made to us in Chriſt, then hence I may learn, <hi>that my firſt work is to come to Chriſt;</hi> I ſay, <hi>the very firſt work of the Soul is to come to Chriſt.</hi> Why? becauſe I can have no right or title to any one mercy, but by <hi>coming</hi> to him, yea until I am <hi>come</hi> to him, for it is my cloſe with Chriſt that gives me right and title to all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coming to Chriſt,</hi> or beleeving, is the great and only qualification that gives a man right and title to the great Promiſe of forgiveneſs, yea and to all other Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Hence when I read in Scripture of ſuch and ſuch Graces that God hath promiſed to give, as he promiſed to give Repentance, Humiliation, Obedience, &amp;c. I am firſt of all as a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yea even whilſt I want theſe things, to goe to Chriſt immediately, and not to think to get theſe things firſt, and after that to go to Chriſt, becauſe the promiſes of theſe things are made to me only in Chriſt, and <hi>coming to Chriſt</hi> is that which gives me right and title to the Promiſes that hold theſe forth; yea no ſpiritual good thing can be in me, or injoyed by me, let mee toyl ever ſo much, till <hi>I come to Chriſt,</hi> for all ſpiritual good comes in by vertue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, all which is in Chriſt, and given forth to ſouls in the way of coming and no other. This informeth us how to look on all thoſe Scriptures wherein Promiſes are made to Duties or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or made conditionally to ſomething in us;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93048:20"/>they are made primarily to Chriſt, and then to works and qualifications as in Chriſt. So, when Promiſes are made to Repentance, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and Self-denial, they are made to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in Chriſt, humility in Chriſt, to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting after Chriſt, as they are wrought by Chriſt, <hi>Without mee yee can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> Joh. 15.5. <hi>It is God that worketh in us,</hi> it is not in man that worketh.</p>
               <p>So that theſe qualifications being urged, other Scriptures urge that they cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, and ſo wee come to reconcile them, and make theſe Scriptures agree. Whenever we annexe promiſes to ſuch works and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, when wee injoyn promiſes out of Chriſt, wee put men upon an impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>But this doth deſtroy Works and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee deſire to ſee works and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, let theſe bee urged before the ſoul taketh the <hi>comfort</hi> of coming, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt. Before the ſoul can ſay Chriſt <hi>is mine,</hi> it is to ſee theſe. A ſoul walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in looſneſs and prophaneneſs, cannot ſo conclude, before a ſoul can ſay Chriſt <hi>is mine,</hi> there are theſe. But a poor ſoul ought to <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt firſt, and this maketh the golden Rule good, all Scripture bee for Chriſt, and do teſtifie of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Then <hi>how miſerable is the condition of all thoſe that ſtand off from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thou ſinner which doſt ſtand off from Chriſt, ſo long as thou doſt thus, thou canſt not of right claime or challenge any one promiſe in all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93048:21"/>the Book of God, and how ſad a condition is this for a poor ſoul to bee in, wherein he cannot lay claim to one promiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>It is the greateſt comfort and ſupport to a gracious heart when he is under afflictions, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. that hee hath a ſtock and ſtore-houſe of promiſes to go unto;</hi> if hee fall into ſin, hee hath a <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> to run unto; if hee bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptation, hee hath a <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>ſupport;</hi> if hee bee <hi>weak,</hi> hee hath a <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>ſtrength,</hi> if <hi>dead,</hi> hee hath a <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>life;</hi> if <hi>ignorant,</hi> hee hath a <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>teaching;</hi> if <hi>perplexed</hi> with fears of falling away, hee hath a <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance</hi> to run unto, in every condition hee hath one <hi>promiſe</hi> or other to comfort him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, ſtay, ſupport, ſtabliſh him.</p>
               <p>But now on the contrary, the condition of that ſoul that ſtands out againſt Chriſt, is of all moſt ſad, moſt deplorable, moſt to bee lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, moſt dreadful; why? becauſe in whatſoever condition he is in, hee hath <hi>no promiſe</hi> that hee can have recourſe unto; it he ſin, hee hath <hi>no promiſe</hi> of pardon, ſo long as he ſtands off from Chriſt. If hee bee in proſperity, he hath <hi>no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> that God will keep him in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. If hee bee in adverſity, he hath <hi>no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> that God will relieve, comfort, ſupport him in that condition. If he be tempted, he hath <hi>no promiſe</hi> that God will deliver him out of, or preſerve him in that condition. If he pray, he hath <hi>no promiſe</hi> that God will hear him. If he ſtand in need of any mercy, ſpiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, he hath <hi>no promiſe</hi> that God will give it.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93048:21"/>
               <p>How wofull is the condition of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? no tongue can expreſs it, nor heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That ſoul which hath a right to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the promiſe going along with him, <hi>hath the preſence of God, and the protection of God going along with,</hi> for Gods preſence and protection go, where his <hi>promiſe</hi> goes. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> they had the <hi>promiſe</hi> going with them, and as the <hi>promiſe</hi> of God went, ſo they were guarded, the Angel of God went with them, one while was before them, another while behinde them, to guard them whereſoever danger was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. So a poor ſoul which hath a right to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> in every condition hath Angels guarding of him, and God with him; whereas that ſoul which hath no right to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> which is the condition of all that ſtand off from Chriſt, they are leſt, as God ſaith of <hi>Ephraim</hi> when hee was gone from God, <hi>Like a Lamb in a large place.</hi> A Lamb in a large place is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger every hour to bee rent in peeces with Dogs and Wolves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the ſoul without the <hi>promiſe,</hi> is every moment in danger of periſhing.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That ſoul which hath the <hi>promiſe, hath God his friend,</hi> for God <hi>is a friend</hi> where his <hi>promiſe</hi> goes, <hi>Abraham</hi> had the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and God was <hi>Abrahams friend:</hi> But now that ſoul which hath <hi>not the promiſe,</hi> God is an <hi>enemy</hi> to that ſoul.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That ſoul which hath the <hi>promiſe, all things work together for his good,</hi> health, ſickneſs, riches, poverty, want, abundance, all work for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93048:22"/>his good; there is a combination together of all things to ſerve that man, and to work him good. That ſoul which hath <hi>not the promiſe,</hi> all things work together for <hi>his evil;</hi> if rich, riches hurt him; if poor, poverty hurts him; if well, and in proſperity, that undoes him; if ſick and in adverſity, that undoes him too; there is a combination of all things to work his ruine.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That ſoul which hath the <hi>promiſe, all the creatures are his friends;</hi> for God makes a league with the creature in the behalf of all thoſe that are in league and covenant with himſelf, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>And in that day will I make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow, and the ſword, and the battel out of the earth, and will make them to lye down ſafely.</hi> But that ſoul which hath <hi>not the promiſe,</hi> all the creatures are his <hi>enemies,</hi> all are banded againſt him. When hee goes abroad amongſt the creatures, hee goes amongſt ſo many mortal enemies, yea let but God give the word of command, and ſay to the army of his creatures fall on, fall on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſinner, and preſently if he eat, his meat will choak him; if hee breathe, the aire will poyſon him; if hee walk in the ſtreets, the houſes will fall upon him; if hee goes abroad in the fields, the beaſts will tear him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him; where-ever hee goes, where-ever hee is, whatſoever hee does, hee is in continual danger.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That ſoul which hath the <hi>promiſe, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93048:22"/>Law hath nothing to do with him;</hi> it cannot curſe him, or condemn him, for hee is not under the Law any longer, but hee is under Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p>But that ſoul which hath not the <hi>promiſe,</hi> the Law <hi>hath to do</hi> with him, the Law curſeth him, hee is under a continual curſe: When hee eats, and drinks, and ſleeps, the Law curſeth him; when hee is walking abroad, talking with his neighbours about his ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Law curſeth him; when hee prayes, and cries out of his ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſtill the Law curſeth him; for, there is nothing can remove the curſe of the Law but the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and that hee hath no right or title unto.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Finally, that ſoul which hath the Promiſe <hi>all in God is on his ſide, and laid out for him;</hi> the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God is on his ſide, and <hi>Mercy</hi> on his ſide, the <hi>Truth</hi> of God makes for him, the <hi>Power</hi> of God, the <hi>Wiſdome</hi> of God are laid out for him; but that ſoul which hath <hi>not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> all in God <hi>is againſt him,</hi> all the Divine Attributes are <hi>his Enemies,</hi> and act againſt him. The Juſtice of God, that is <hi>againſt him,</hi> that cries Damn the ſinner; the Mercy of God is <hi>againſt him,</hi> and ſaith Mercy, Juſtice do what thou wilt with that Sinner, I will not ſpeak a word for him, for he hath nothing to do with me. The Truth of God that <hi>is againſt him,</hi> that ſpeaks not a word of peace or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to him.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdome of God, and the Power of God, theſe act <hi>againſt him</hi> too.</p>
               <p>How miſerable then is the eſtate of that man
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93048:23"/>or woman that ſtands out againſt Jeſus Chriſt, he hath nothing to do with the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and wanting the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> how woeful his condition is, you have a little heard.</p>
               <p>Vſe 3. Then <hi>how bleſſed is their condition who are married to the Lord Jeſus, why all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are theirs.</hi> Having Chriſt for thy <hi>Husband,</hi> thou haſt this as a <hi>Joynture</hi> with him, all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of God in him made over unto thee. So that is there any good thing in Heaven or Earth that God hath by <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> given his people? all this is thine. All good things in this life given by <hi>promiſe,</hi> they are <hi>thine;</hi> glory hereafter given by <hi>promiſe?</hi> it is thine.

               <p>If a poor beggar-woman that hath not a penny, or foot of land, ſhould marry a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath great coffers of gold and ſilver, large poſſeſſions, ſhe may now go about from one coffer to another, and ſay, all this is <hi>mine,</hi> all this ſilver is <hi>mine,</hi> all this gold is <hi>mine;</hi> and ſhe may ride from one Mannor to another, and ſay all this land is <hi>mine,</hi> and all theſe trees are <hi>mine;</hi> why they are all my <hi>Husbands,</hi> and I have a <hi>propriety</hi> in him; and ſo a <hi>propriety</hi> in them. So a poor ſoul that is <hi>married</hi> to Chriſt,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93048:23"/>hee may read over every <hi>promiſe,</hi> and ſay, this is <hi>mine,</hi> hee may look heaven and earth over and ſay <hi>all is mine,</hi> all that is good in either is <hi>mine,</hi> for all is the eſtate and inheritance of my <hi>Husband</hi> Chriſt, and I have a propriety in him, and ſo in all.</p>
               <p>There is never a poor Scullion, nor a Drudge, nor a Chimny-ſweeper, but if his, or her ſoul be married to Chriſt, hee may go about, and look the world over, and hee may read the Book of God, and look heaven over, and ſay <hi>all is mine,</hi> for all theſe things are given by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and the <hi>promiſe</hi> is <hi>mine,</hi> Chriſt in whom all the <hi>promiſes</hi> are, being <hi>mine.</hi> Saints do too little think of this, what they are as they are in Chriſt, and married to him, were our hearts ever full of ſuch actual thoughts and conſiderations, I am married to Chriſt, I am united to him, and therefore all the <hi>promiſes</hi> are <hi>mine,</hi> all the good things <hi>promiſed</hi> here, and hereafter, are <hi>mine,</hi> they would not go about as they do, moping and mumping, and dreaming all their dayes, neither rejoycing in their inheritance, nor act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their heavenly Husband.</p>
               <p>O Saints, take a view of the <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> of your condition! look it over in the heighth, and depth, and length, and breadth of it, bee proud of it, ſo as to vexe the Devil, and ſhame, and provoke the world. Look upon your ſelves as you are, and eſteem your ſelves as you are.</p>
               <p>Do not go about whining and whuling, and ſay, <hi>O I have nothing, none is ſo poor as I;</hi> you ſhame and diſgrace your Husband, hath Chriſt married you, and hath hee ſuch a great eſtate,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93048:24"/>is hee ſo tranſcendently rich in promiſes, and what hath hee given you nothing? You would make Chriſt an ill husband. Well may ſinners bee ſhie and afraid to bee married to Chriſt, when Saints by their carriage, their whining and whuling, and complaining, ſpeak ſo ill of him.</p>
               <p>Yea whether you ſpeak as you ſhould do, whether there bee any truth or reaſon in that you ſay, let wiſe men judge.</p>
               <p>If a man that hath many vaſt poſſeſſions of land, and cheſts of mony, and ſhops, and warehouſes full of rich commodities, ſhould ſay to his neighbour, <hi>I have nothing,</hi> I am afraid I ſhall ſtarve, or come to the Pariſh ere long, would not they count him mad? So when a Saint which hath a Magazine of <hi>promiſes,</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>precious promiſes,</hi> the meaneſt of which is of more worth and value than a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhall whine, and ſay, <hi>I have nothing;</hi> I know not what to do, or how to live.—</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Aye, but will ſome poor ſoul ſay, Indeed were I ſure that all theſe promiſes were mine, I would not ſay ſo, but al as that is my burden, I fear there are none of them mine; they indeed whoſe theſe promiſes are, are rich, and ſuch may rejoyce, and ſo could I were theſe mine, but my affliction is, I fear they are not mine.</hi>

Thou poor ſoul, which if thou wert to dye to morrow, haſt never a <hi>promiſe</hi> to run to, to take comfort in, to bear thy poor dying ſoul upon; <hi>O come to Chriſt,</hi> and all ſhall bee thine, for all the <hi>promiſes</hi> are his, they are all in him, and by having him thou ſhalt have all.</p>
               <p>O ſouls, did you but know the worth of Chriſt in this reſpect, I mean conſidering this, that all the promiſes are ſtored up in him, you would not go quietly out of this place, you would not ſleep one night more, without hearts breathing after Chriſt, and rowling your ſelves on him.</p>
               <p>Saith Chriſt to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Joh. 4.10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> So ſay I, poor ſoul, if thou didſt but know the <hi>gift of God,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, if thou didſt but know the <hi>worth of Chriſt;</hi> If thou didſt but know what <hi>precious promiſes,</hi> what multitudes of them, and what tranſcendent worth is in every one, the meaneſt of them, are in Chriſt, thy heart would not contain without breathing, thy tongue would not be ſilent any longer without asking the Father to give thee this Chriſt.</p>
               <p>O how many poor ſouls, now here, which did they but know the worth of one promiſe,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93048:26"/>would now cry out to God, O Chriſt, Chriſt, Chriſt, Lord give this Chriſt to mee, and to mee. Were the worth of promiſes known, then the worth of Chriſt, in whom all the promiſes are, would bee better known.</p>
               <p>Put caſe, man, woman, thou wert ſure thou ſhouldeſt dye to morrow, and hadſt now all the ſins that ever thou haſt committed from thy cradle to this day, lying upon thee, and burdening of thee, and thy conſcience torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee for them, and thou wert at hell gate, and hell fire ready to receive thee, and ſwallow thee up for ever, what then in thy account would a <hi>promiſe</hi> of pardon and remiſſion of ſins, a <hi>promiſe</hi> of heaven and eternal life bee worth? What? Why all that I have in the world, ſaith the man, yea a whole world, ten thouſand worlds, were there ſo many, or had I ſo many.</p>
               <p>But it may bee ſome of you are ſo blockiſh and ſenſeleſs and regardleſs of things of this nature, that by this that I have ſaid (you are ſo little acquainted with ſuch things) you would not know the <hi>worth of a promiſe,</hi> therefore to ſpeak in a more familiar way, and to ſhew you the worth of a promiſe a little from things you do know.</p>
               <p>Put the caſe, now man, or woman, thou wert condemned to dye ſome cruel death, full of the greateſt tortures that can bee imagined, ſuch a death as ſome Hiſtories tell us one <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villac</hi> which traiterouſly murdered the King of <hi>France</hi> was put to, who had firſt one of his hands cut off, then the other, then was carried

Now ſuppoſe thou wert condemned to dye ſuch a death as this was, and this were to be executed upon thee to morrow, if ſo bee the Prince ſhould come to thee over-night, and give thee a <hi>promiſe of pardon,</hi> that hee would pardon thee, and ſave thee from this cruel death, what thinkeſt thou (ſuppoſe the caſe were ſo) in thy account, would ſuch a <hi>promiſe</hi> bee worth? O I am perſwaded if the caſe were ſo, thou wouldeſt not know how thy heart would bee ſo extraordinarily taken, to ſpeak the worth of it; the very hearing of a word of pardon at ſuch a time would ſo overcome thee, as that thou wouldeſt be ready to dye for joy.</p>
               <p>And poor ſoul, know it, that ſuch a <hi>promiſe</hi> as this, is but a <hi>poor promiſe,</hi> not worth the being called a <hi>promiſe,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God in Chriſt; the meaneſt, the leaſt of which are far greater, and of more invaluable worth than hundreds of ſuch as this.</p>
               <p>This is onely a <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>temporal</hi> life, and of deliverance from a temporal puniſhment, which may laſt three or four dayes; but the <hi>promiſes</hi> of Chriſt, are <hi>promiſes</hi> of an <hi>eternal</hi> life, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>eternal</hi> torments; and if one of theſe <hi>promiſes</hi> of Chriſt are of ſo great, and of ſuch invaluable worth, then what is Chriſt

And if poor ſinners would do thus, how many godly wives hearts would leap to hear this, coming from their carnal husbands, and godly children, to hear this from their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parents.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Demonſtrat.</hi> 1. From the Text, <hi>They are in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 From the great <hi>obligations lying upon God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt to ſee to it, that the promiſes be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Engagement 1. <hi>Promiſes cost Chriſt dear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had them;</hi> though they are a gift to us, yet Chriſt paid for them. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had the <hi>promiſes</hi> for nothing, but he by his fall ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring away the <hi>promiſes,</hi> none of his ſeed could ever have been partakers of any of them, had not Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſtepped in, and by paying a price to his Father Juſtice redeemed the <hi>promiſes</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Now the price was no leſs than his owne life, and the promiſes having coſt Chriſt ſo dear, this obligeth him to look to it, that they be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Engagem. 2. <hi>Chriſt cannot put the promiſes to other uſe;</hi> For, for himſelf hee hath no need of them; the evil Angels, and good too, God did in a manner except them from having benefit by them, when he willed his Son to take mans nature upon him rather than theirs.</p>
               <p>Now adding this to the former, that the <hi>promiſe</hi> coſt Chriſt ſo dear, and can be put to no other uſe than to bee fulfilled to his people, this may give us good aſſurance, both of the great engagement that lyeth upon Chriſt to do it, and alſo that it ſhall bee done; For if a man hath bought a thing deare, and there is

               <p>Engage. 3. <hi>The promiſes are now in Chriſts hand.</hi> Chriſt takes it ill from men, if they have a talent in their hands, and do not improve it, as in the Parable of the Sloathful ſervant. Now Chriſt having ſo great a talent in his hand as the rich treaſure of the <hi>promiſes,</hi> which talent, as it may bee improved much for the glory of God, and the good of his people, ſo can it not bee improved any way but by fulfilling them, and in caſe Chriſt ſee them not fulfilled, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lyes by in his hand uſeleſs, which cannot but engage Chriſt to ſee to it that the <hi>promiſes</hi> bee fulfilled; this the Apoſtle ſeemeth to hint at in the Text, when hee ſaith , <hi>All are in him,</hi> i.e. they are in Chriſts hand, in his keeping, and therefore ſaith hee, <hi>They are Yea, and Amen,</hi> i.e. true, certain, immutable, ſhall moſt certainly bee fulfilled, Chriſt will not ſuffer ſuch a Talent to bee in his hand, and not improve it.</p>
               <p>Engage. 4. <hi>The promiſes are not onely in the hand of Chriſt, but Chriſt hath received them of his Father for this end, that hee ſhould give them forth to ſinners.</hi>

               <p>God gave them into Chriſts hand, upon this condition, that hee ſhould not keep them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not let them lye by uſeleſs, but give then forth to poor ſinners, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. <hi>Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear.</hi>

               <p>Engage. 5. <hi>Chriſt by promiſe is engaged to ſee them fulfilled.</hi> A mans promiſe lays an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and an obligation upon him; Chriſt hath promiſed to ſee them accompliſhed. Hee gives us his promiſe upon his Fathers promiſe, that the promiſes ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>And behold, I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you.</hi> God the Father had promiſed to ſend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, here Chriſt adds his promiſe to it, as to ſay, Hath my Father promiſed the Spirit, why I do promiſe it ſhall be made good, for I will ſend him.</p>
               <p>Now poor ſoul, doſt thou doubt whether the <hi>Promiſes</hi> ſhall be fulfilled, why conſider a little what engagement lies upon Chriſt, to ſee to the fulfilling of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I may demonſtrate the truth from thoſe <hi>great ties and engagements that lye upon God the Father,</hi> to ſee to it, that the Promiſes bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. As there are great engagements lye upon Chriſt, ſo upon the Father alſo.</p>
               <p>Engage 1. <hi>The declaration God hath made of his own name engageth him to it,</hi> Exod. 34.6. God hath declared this to be a part of his Name, that the is abundant in goodneſs and truth, and how can this bee, ſhould hee not fulfill his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</p>
               <p>Engage. 2. <hi>Gods faithfulneſs engageth him to it,</hi> Heb. 10.23. <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promiſed.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 <hi>He waits ſo long till his own body was dead, and</hi> Sarahs <hi>wombe;</hi> the means by which the promiſe ſhould be brought about, there was <hi>a death</hi> upon it, ſo as that in a Natural way there was no hope, and therefore hee is ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93048:37"/>in hope againſt hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. did not this much heighten the diſcouragements, and make difficultie greater? might not <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay, well, now I ſee there is no hope?</p>
               <p n="3">3 After God had given him a Son, <hi>yet God commands him to offer him up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did not this make difficulty the greater? <hi>Abraham</hi> might ſay, This Son of mine is the only Son in whom the Promiſe is to bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and God commands me to offer him up.</p>
               <p>Now notwithſtanding all theſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves; before he had a Son, hee beleeved that God who had promiſed was able to perform it; and after, when God bids him ſacrifice his Son, God ſtill was able.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Gods remembrance of his promiſe makes him to work wonderouſly over the head of all difficulties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.42. compared with the former verſes, <hi>For hee remembred his holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yet God remembers his promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.45. compared with former verſes; <hi>And he remembred for them his Covenant</hi> — yet ver. 34. <hi>They did not deſtroy the Nations concerning whom the Lord commanded them,</hi> verſ. 35. <hi>But were mingled among the Heathen, and learned their works,</hi> verſ. 43. <hi>They provoked him with their counſel; and yet God remembred his Covenant,</hi> v. 45 and as he remembers his promiſe, ſo he will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it.</p>

               <p>Chriſt before his death gave his Diſciples <hi>a promiſe</hi> of the Spirit; after this they deal more unkindly with him than ever, <hi>Peter</hi> denies him, ſome ſleep when hee was in the midſt of his agony, all forſake him and flye, and yet Chriſt fulfills his promiſe to them.</p>
               <p>How exceedingly did <hi>Jehoram</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> make <hi>Judah</hi> to ſin? 2 King. 8 18. <hi>He walked in the way of the Kings of Iſrael, as did the houſe of Ahab, for the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ahab was his wife, and hee did evill in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for all this, becauſe God had made a promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> that hee ſhould alwayes have a light, hee will not therefore deſtroy <hi>Judah,</hi> as verſ. 19. <hi>yet the Lord would not deſtroy Judah for David his ſervants ſake, as hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give him alway a light, and to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> Iſa. 54.9. is ſaid to bee <hi>like the waters of Noah;</hi> when God had brought a floud upon the world in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, God ſware to <hi>Noah</hi> hee would not drown the carth, as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>For the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth,</hi> — it ſhould be rendred, <hi>Although the imagination.</hi> —</p>
               <p>Such is Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> that hee will not break it, although the heart of man bee evill.</p>
               <p>Again, thou haſt ſinned, what is thy ſin, but a breach of the Law? Now the <hi>Promiſe</hi> was before the Law, and therefore thy breach of the Law cannot diſanul the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3. v. 15, 16, 17. <hi>And this I ſay, that the Covenant that

Why, onely a healing of the backſliding nature that is in us, this is a <hi>promiſe</hi> of the Covenant of grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. v. 38. and 40. compared, <hi>And they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</hi> verſ. 40. <hi>And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to doe them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 <hi>Why</hi> it muſt needs be ſo.</p>
               <p>Reaſon 1. <hi>Becauſe the Covenant of Grace it ſelf in the firſt making of it, in the continual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of it, and in the application thereof,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93048:45"/>hath all along reſpect to perſons as ſinners, and therefore ſurely all the promiſes thereof muſt bee made to perſons under that notion.</hi> When Jeſus Chriſt firſt ſtruck hands with the Father, and entred into Covenant for man, man was then conſidered as <hi>a ſinner,</hi> one that had broken Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, and was now liable to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Juſtice, or elſe what need had there been of a Sureties entring Bond in mans behalf. Look upon the Promulgation of this Covenant all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and it is to man under the notion of being <hi>a ſinner.</hi> In the very firſt Promulgation thereof to <hi>Adam,</hi> what was there in him Antecedent, or preparatory, ſave only his <hi>Sin?</hi> Gen. 3.</p>
               <p>In the firſt clear preaching thereof by Chriſt and his Apoſtles to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was it not preached to them as <hi>Sinners?</hi> Read Chriſts Commiſſion to the Seventy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.5: Firſt <hi>ſay peace,</hi> that this peace is Goſpel peace is clear, becauſe they which reject it, reject the Kingdome of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. the perſons to whom this is to be preached, they are the unworthy as well as the worthy, for they were to preach this <hi>to all</hi> where they came, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. yea they are called <hi>Wolves,</hi> which marks them out to be <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of the worſt ſort of all, as verſ. 3. <hi>Behold, I ſend you forth as Lambs among Wolves.</hi> The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the delivery of this is in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>Out of all which I obſerve, that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or promulgation of the Goſpel, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is to perſons, <hi>as ſinners,</hi> for if ſo be the perſons the Seventy were ſent out amongſt, were <hi>ſinners,</hi> and if ſo bee the firſt thing they were to preach to them, were <hi>Goſpel peace,</hi> then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93048:46"/>muſt it of neceſſity be to them <hi>as ſinners,</hi> without we ſhould conceive, that whereſoever the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel comes, the Spirit of God goes before, and works upon mens hearts, making them of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> no <hi>ſinners,</hi> and that before ever a word is ſpoken to them, which granted, wee have no need of the Word, you may throw away your Bibles, the Spirit doth work without them.</p>
               <p>In the firſt preaching thereof to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, it was to perſons <hi>as ſinners,</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> laſt, 15. it was to be preached to <hi>all</hi> rational Creatures, and under what conſideration could this bee preached to <hi>all and every</hi> man, but this of being <hi>ſinners,</hi> for none will ſay that all to whom the Goſpel came were righteous and qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and yet it was to be preached to <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that at three remarkable times as ever the World ſaw, <hi>viz.</hi> at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel to the World, the firſt clear preaching thereof to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the firſt preaching thereof to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace was ever preached to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>as ſinners;</hi> as in the Promulgation, ſo it the Application, is it not to perſons <hi>as ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> We have an expreſs place for this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>And when I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own bloud, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy bloud, live; yea I ſail unto thee when thou waſt in thy bloud live</hi> — ver. 8. <hi>Now when I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſs, yea I ſware unto thee, and entred into a Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93048:46"/>mine.</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>Then I waſhed thee with water</hi> — Here wee may read of the Application of this New Covenant to the Creature, and all the benefits thereof, as our effectual Vocation, our Juſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, &amp;c. and in what ſtate or condition is the Creature when all this is applied to it, why ſee verſ. 6. polluted in its bloud, <hi>Thou waſt in thy bloud, in thy bloud, in thy bloud, and then</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I ſaid unto thee, live; and that time when thou waſt in thy bloud was the time of love</hi> —</p>
               <p>Now this I ſay, if it bee ſo that the Covenant of Grace in the firſt making of it, in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual promulgation of it, in the application of it to the Creature, be ſtill to perſons <hi>as ſinners;</hi> then ſurely all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of Grace (wherein the whole, or ſubſtance of this new Covenant lies) muſt likewiſe bee to perſons under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>Becauſe ſinners as they are ſinners, are the fitteſt objects of Grace and Mercy.</hi> A man in miſery, whilſt he is in it (whether he be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or not ſenſible thereof) is the fitteſt object of mercy; when he is come out of it, he is not ſo fit an object of mercy as before, whilſt hee was in it. So <hi>a Sinner</hi> as he <hi>is a ſinner,</hi> whilſt hee is going on in ways of ſin, is the fitteſt and moſt proper object for mercy to lay hold of; and hence the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of Grace are made to perſons under that notion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Becauſe otherwiſe they could not bee grace;</hi> grace beſtowed upon one that hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tited the ſame, is not grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>And if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93048:47"/>no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more grace, otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man ſhould ſay to another, you have done thus and thus for me, and therefore I <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> to do thus for you, this were not grace; but to ſay, you have done what you can againſt me, and yet <hi>I promiſe</hi> to do thus for you, this is grace indeed: ſo here, contraries deſtroy each other.</p>
               <p>To be free, and to be upon condition, are ſo directly contrary, each to other, that they can never ſtand; let the condition be never ſo mean, or little, yet it deſtroys grace. If a man condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with another to give him a hundred pound by the year, for that which is not worth two pence, yet ſo long as lice gives what hee gives upon condition, its no longer a free gift, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thing he receives bee of no value in compariſon of that which he gives.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if God give the condition, it may bee Grace notwithſtanding, as if I promiſe another a thing upon condition of ſo much mony, and give him as much mony at I require of him, then is the thing of grace though upon condition, becauſe I give him the condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Grant it to bee ſo, yet then it will follow, that ſeeing Chriſt gives the condition, I muſt firſt come to him as <hi>a poor ſinner</hi> under that notion, who as yet hath not the condition, that I may have the ſame, and ſo I muſt come to Chriſt firſt of all; and ſeeing I cannot come to him but in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> I muſt therefore alſo lay hold of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> before I have the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea further, ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt gives
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93048:47"/>no Spiritual mercy but by vertue of ſome <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> it will therefore follow hence that the <hi>promiſe</hi> is made to me before ever I have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the Condition being a fruit of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and not the <hi>Promiſe</hi> a fruit of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo conſequently the <hi>promiſe</hi> of Grace notwithſtanding all, is made to me, as I am <hi>a ſinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reaſ. 4. <hi>Becauſe God would give no juſt reaſon to any to exempt themſelves from laying hold of the grace of God.</hi> Now ſhould God make <hi>promiſes</hi> to perſons as they are thus qualified, there would be juſt ground for many poor ſouls to exempt themſelves; as for inſtance, Should I promiſe a man to doe him ſuch a courteſie would he give me ſo much money, or do ſuch a peece of work for me, a poor man now which hath not ſo much money to give, or a lame man, weak, ſickly men, who are not able to do ſuch a peece of ſervice, might juſtly exempt themſelves; ſo, ſhould God <hi>promiſe</hi> upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, thoſe that want the condition might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For <hi>objections,</hi> they are many, ſome drawn from Scripture, and ſome from Reaſon, I ſhall briefly ſpeak to the principal of either.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>This is contrary to the preaching of</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt,</hi> Matth. 3.2. <hi>yea of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as Chap.</hi> 4.17. <hi>who both preach repentance firſt.</hi> Repent, for the Kingdome of heaven is at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though in order of words <hi>Repentance</hi> is firſt, yet not in the order of matter, for the reaſon of a thing is before the thing it ſelf; now
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93048:48"/>what is the reaſon why they ſhould <hi>Repent?</hi> why, becauſe <hi>the Kingdome of heaven is at hand;</hi> What is the meaning of that? why the Grace of God, or the Kingdome of Grace; peace with God, free and full remiſſion of ſins is coming towards you (for the preaching of peace and remiſſion of ſins is called the Kingdome of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.5. compared with verſ. 9.11. <hi>Say, peace be to this houſe</hi> — ver. 9. <hi>Say unto them, the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</hi> And preaching of the Goſpel is called preaching of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 25. <hi>Among I whom I have gone preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdome of God</hi> —) therefore <hi>Repent;</hi> ſo that we have firſt the declaration of the Goſpel, Free Grace, full remiſſion of ſins by Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and from ſuch conſiderations they are to <hi>Repent;</hi> ſo that the Goſpel comes firſt before the word of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and therefore it is to them as they are <hi>Sinners,</hi> for it findes them ſuch.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>But in</hi> Matth. 11. verſ. 28. <hi>Chriſt bids ſuch as are</hi> weary and heavie laden <hi>to come to him; therefore men muſt first be weary, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie laden before they come to Chriſt, or the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>and therefore it is not made to them</hi> as ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When Chriſt bids thoſe that are <hi>weary and heavie laden</hi> come to him, doth it therefore follow he excludes all others? I grant ſuch are to come, and ſuch are moſt backward and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to come, and therefore called; but doth it follow therefore that no other muſt come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that theſe, and only theſe are called? If a Prince ſend forth Proclamation to a company of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93048:48"/>to come in and he will pardon them; and becauſe hee knows that there are ſome few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are ſo ſenſible of what they have done, and brought themſelves into by their rebellion, that they will never come upon this general Proclamation, but for fear will run away; he therefore ſends particularly to theſe by name, you and you, who dare not come for fear of being hanged, come I will pardon you, and you; doth it therefore follow becauſe theſe have a call (as it were by name) therefore now all the reſt who have a general call are excluded? So here — but,</p>
               <p n="2">2 This faine would I know, what is the ſtate and condition that ſouls are then in when they are thus <hi>weary and heavie laden?</hi> Are they in the ſtate and condition <hi>of Sinners</hi> or not, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous or unrighteous perſons? one they muſt bee. If you ſay they are not <hi>Sinners,</hi> but righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſons, then I ask how came they thus? is it by their being <hi>weary and heavie laden</hi> barely, or is it by their applying of the <hi>Promiſe?</hi> if it be by their being weary and heavie laden, then what need you preſs them to come to Chriſt for Juſtification, when as they have the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by this their qualification. If it be by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> on having it applied to them, then it will follow, that notwithſtanding this their qualification, that they are <hi>Sinners,</hi> and ſo remaine until they apply the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> or have it applied to them; ſo that the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> though we ſhould ſay it is made to them as ſuch, yet of neceſſity it muſt bee made to them <hi>as Sinners</hi> ſtill, <hi>i.e.</hi> perſons in a ſtare of ſin and miſery, for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93048:49"/>until the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is applied unto them, though they are ſuch, yet they are in no other or better condition than <hi>ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>But faith it the condition of the Promiſe, and the Apoſtle tells us,</hi> Galat. 3.22. that the promiſe is given to thoſe that beleeve; <hi>now a perſon beleeving is not a</hi> Sinner, <hi>therefore not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Faith</hi> is not the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> but it is the fruit of the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> if it be the <hi>condition,</hi> I ask then, whether or no is it a <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be wrought by us of ourſelves, or doth God give it us?</p>
               <p>It it be to bee wrought by our ſelves, then is the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Grace worſe, and harder than the Covenant of Works; for though it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Adam</hi> to do and live, yet he had then a power of doing, but ſo have not wee now of beleeving.</p>
               <p>Yea, no more was required of him than what was put into his nature, for the Covenant of Works was written in his nature, but ſo is not <hi>faith</hi> in ours, nay, that <hi>faith</hi> with which we go to the <hi>Promiſe</hi> for Juſtification never was in our natures, for <hi>Adam</hi> had not this in innocency, neither was it neceſſary lie ſhould have it till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall.</p>
               <p>If it be given us of God (as theſe Scriptures prove, <hi>viz.</hi> Epheſ. 2.8. <hi>For by grace are yee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Phil. 1.29,) then it is given by vertue of ſome <hi>Promiſe,</hi> for God gives nothing but by vertue of ſome <hi>promiſe,</hi> which <hi>promiſe</hi> can be no other but the <hi>free promiſe,</hi> the <hi>promiſe</hi> of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93048:49"/>grace, and therefore the <hi>promiſe</hi> of grace is made to us ſtill <hi>as ſinners,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> it ſelf is but a fruit thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As for that place Gal. 3.22. <hi>That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might bee given to thoſe that beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>Beleeving</hi> is not the <hi>condition,</hi> but a deſignation of the perſons to whom the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is given, <hi>i.e.</hi> to <hi>beleevers,</hi> or a declaration of the way in which the <hi>promiſe</hi> is given, <hi>i.e.</hi> in a way of <hi>beleeving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>But if the promiſes of grace are made to perſons as ſinners, then to all ſinners, for that which belongs to any as ſuch, belongs to all as ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When I ſay it is made to <hi>Sinners as Sinners,</hi> the <hi>[as]</hi> is not to bee underſtood as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a cauſality, <hi>i. e.</hi> that their being <hi>Sinners</hi> is the cauſe why the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is made to them, for were it ſo, then the <hi>promiſe</hi> of grace being only an effect of ſuch a cauſe, ſhould extend to one as well as another, where there is the ſame cauſe to produce it, and ſo it ſhould by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence reach all and every man, all being <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> but wee are to underſtand it onely as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of the preſent ſtate and condition that thoſe perſons are in, to whom the <hi>promiſe</hi> is made, they are for the preſent in a ſtate of ſin and miſery, though not this their condition, but the free love of God, and the riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to poor ſouls in ſuch a condition, is the cauſe why the <hi>promiſe</hi> of grace is made to them, and ſo it follows not, that it is made to <hi>every man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for example, If a man dye, and give a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93048:50"/>hundred pound a year for the uſe or the poor, and put ſuch a clauſe as this is in his Will, I will have onely ſuch poor as have nothing in the world to live upon, but are forced to beg, to partake of this my charity. Doth it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that hee gives this hundred pound yearly to all the poor which beg all the world over? Not ſo, it ſhews that it is given to ſuch as are in the ſtate of beggars; but it follows not, that all thoſe all the world over, who are in that ſtate have a right hereto.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, ſuppoſe a thouſand perſons were condemned, ſome for Treaſon, and ſome for other miſdemeanors, the Prince or Judge ſends a pardon amongſt them to bee given forth to many of them, and therein is ſuch a clauſe, that none ſhall have benefit by it, but ſuch perſons as were traitors againſt him, and condemned for treaſon, it doth not therefore follow, that every one which was condemned for treaſon, ſhould have the benefit of the pardon: No, it onely ſhews that perſons under that condemnation are the ſubjects of it, but it doth not follow, all ſhall enjoy it, becauſe there may be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons condemned for that offence then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don doth extend unto, but thoſe to whom it doth extend, are perſons under ſuch a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>So, when we ſay the <hi>Tromiſes</hi> of Grace are made to perſons <hi>as Sinners, i. e.</hi> as they are in ſuch a ſtate and condition, it doth not now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they are made to <hi>all ſinners;</hi> no, but it onely ſhews that they are perſons in ſuch a ſtate and condition which onely ſhall have benefit by the <hi>promiſe</hi> of Grace.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93048:50"/>
               <p>Object. 5. <hi>But thus to tender the Promiſes of Grace to perſons as they are ſinners, is the only way to make men preſume and to harden them in their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Not ſo, The grace of God teacheth a quire contrary leſſon, <hi>Tit</hi> 2. v. 11, 12. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, teaching us that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, for yee are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (dearly beloved) let us cleauſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 I grant, ſome from the preaching of free Grace, take occaſion to preſume, yet is not the fault in the grace of God, nor preaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but in themſelves, and the naughtineſs of their hearts. As when a Magiſtrate proclaims pardon freely to a company of perſons in actual rebellion, if they from the grace and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Magiſtrate, ſhall take occaſion to perſiſt, or others to riſe up in rebellion, the fault is not in the Magiſtrate, or his ſo doing, but in them, it is in him an act of grace and clemency, it is their wickedneſs doth abuſe it: So in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Jeſus Chriſt is ſet up as welt to be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone, and a rock of offence to ſome, as to be ſalvation to others. God hath laid Chriſt in <hi>Sion</hi> for theſe two great ends, 1 Pet. 2. v. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a chief corner ſtone, elect, precious, and hee that beleeveth on him ſhall not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93048:51"/>Unto you therefore which beleeve hee is precious, but unto them which bee diſobedient, the ſtone which the builders diſallowed, the ſame is made the head of the corner, and a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which ſtumble at the word.</hi> Rom 9.33. <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone, a rock of offence.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Goſpel is preached, there are two great deſignes on foot together, the greateſt that ever were in world, <hi>viz.</hi> of the eternal ſalvation, or condemnation of poor <hi>ſinners.</hi> The one glorified Juſtice, the other Mercy; what if ſome hearing the word of grace, do preſume, it may bee God may have a ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that ſome in hearing the grace of God, ſhould preſume and ſtumble at that to their eternal condemnation, which had they in love and ſincerity imbraced, would have been to their everlaſting ſalvation.

What haſt thou to object, why thou wilt not receive it, why, art thou not a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and is not all this to <hi>ſinners?</hi> Why, why then wilt thou bee a Sot, and go to hell at the laſt, when heaven and ſalvation is to bee had, if thou wilt but <hi>come</hi> to the <hi>promiſe?</hi> O you <hi>great Sinners,</hi> thinke I beſeech you, when you are at your cups, with your Queans, your oaths in your mouths.

               <p>I dare ſay the ſerious conſideration hereof, would make your hearts more to hate and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſuch wayes and practices, and bring you ſooner to leave them, than all the terrors of hell, will, or can do. When a poor ſoul ſhall reaſon the caſe with himſelf thus, What, have I been a rebel againſt the good God, theſe ten, twenty, thirty, forty years, and is hee ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, notwithſtanding all, to proclaim life and ſalvation to me, what to mee? O then ſhall I ſtill bee a wretch, and ſin againſt this gracious God, and trample under foot all his love? No, fie for ſhame!</p>
               <p>Object. O but you will ſay, <hi>Indeed now whilst you are ſpeaking, my heart is inclinable to what you ſay, and I have now a good minde to leave off my former courſes and practices, but alas I have not power to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Come to Chriſt in the promiſe, and hee will give thee a power, hee can, and will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy corruptions, it thou waiteſt on him. Thou poor ſoul lookeſt upon it now as a hard and difficult thing, to forſake ſuch and ſuch courſes as are (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb) bred in the bone, and thou all thy life time haſt been accuſtomed too; but Chriſt can make this thou lookeſt upon as hard, and even impoſſible, eaſie to thee. Many a ſoul at his firſt converſion, hath looked upon it as a hard and even impoſſible thing to forgoe ſuch and ſuch ſinnes and luſts, which in his natural condition were his <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> and his heart was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93048:53"/>addicted unto, and hath verily thought hee ſhould never do it, who yet afterwards hath found it eaſier by far than hee imagined, yea ſo eaſie he hath ſtood in admiration thereat, when God hath once turned his heart, hee hath found as much, yea more pleaſure in the wayes and ſervice of God, than ever hee ſound in his old courſes.</p>
               <p>For when God puts a new nature into the ſoul, then all things go another way; now there are new principles, new apprehenſions, new motives, and all the wheels of the ſoul run ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; when there was nothing but an old nature, then all things ran ſin-ward, and hell-ward, but now God having put a new nature in, there are new motions, and all run holineſs-ward, and heaven-ward.</p>
               <p>O therefore pray to God to change your hearts, and you ſhall ſee how eaſie that will bee, which now you ſuppoſe ſo hard, and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and wondrouſly ſweet thoſe wayes of godlineſs will bee, which now are ſo grievous.</p>

               <p>You which have heard this, cannot go home and follow your ſins, but your Conſciences wil fly in your faces when you do it, and put you upon a wrack.</p>

               <p>It was even in the times of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Abraham lived by Faith.</hi> See that notable place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. to 22. <hi>who againſt hope beleeved in hope, that hee might become the Father of many Nations.</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>And being not weak in faith, he conſidered not his own body now dead, when hee was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadneſs of</hi> Sarahs <hi>womb,</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>Hee ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeleef, but

               </p>
               <p>Here the Holy Ghoſt makes a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the famous ſtory of <hi>Abrahams</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and ſets forth that <hi>life of faith</hi> which was in that holy man; <hi>who againſt hope</hi> — when nothing was left for <hi>Abraham</hi> to build <hi>hope</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a way of ſenſe, but all things were at that paſs that they made againſt his <hi>hope,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to deſtroy it, yet then <hi>Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> God comes to <hi>Abraham</hi> when that he was now about a hundred years old, and his Wife <hi>Sarah</hi> near as many, and promiſeth him a Son by his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> and that in his ſeed ſhould all Nations be bleſſed; well might <hi>Abraham</hi> now ſay, God hath promiſed me a Son, and that in my ſeed ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.

               <p>But ſaith the Text, <hi>Abraham conſidered not theſe things,</hi> (here was the <hi>life of faith</hi>) hee did not ſuffer his minde to run on theſe things, hee did not ponder them in a way of reaſon and ſenſe, but <hi>againſt hope, beleeved in hope,</hi> kept up his hope in a way of pure <hi>beleeving,</hi> when all things to ſenſe ſeemed to deſtroy his hope, and ſo was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God.</p>

                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. the Apoſtle reckons up through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Chapter many of the Worthies of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Come to the New, we ſhall ſee ſtill it is; if in the Old, when the Covenant of Grace by which this <hi>life of faith</hi> is begotten, &amp; cheriſhed, was more dark, and lay wrapped up in Types and ſhadows, then much more is it in the New, wherein the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is clearly revealed, and Goſpel Truths unvayled.

               <p>
                  <hi>For a ſoul conſtantly, quietly, and orderly, to reſt upon the Promiſe and Power of God, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all good expected or hoped for, the removing or turning to good, all evil preſent or feared.</hi> In which deſcription, are theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Here is the <hi>act it ſelf,</hi> with the <hi>manner</hi> of acting, which the ſoul that <hi>lives by faith</hi> puts forth; it is an act of <hi>reſt,</hi> and reliance, and that <hi>conſtantly, quietly,</hi> and <hi>orderly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>act it ſelf,</hi> the nature of it, it is not an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>aſſurance,</hi> but an act of <hi>reliance,</hi> recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence, dependence, or adherence; the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>aſſurance</hi> is not ſo properly <hi>faith</hi> as <hi>ſenſe,</hi> for when my ſoul is <hi>aſſured,</hi> I do ſee and behold the love of God, and my own ſalvation, and I do feel the ſame within me, and this is <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed I grant it, that the ſoul which <hi>lives by faith</hi> hath oftentimes <hi>aſſurance,</hi> and more <hi>conſtantly</hi> than another, he puts forth more <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>aſſurance</hi> than a weaker beleever doth which lives by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> yet are not theſe the <hi>differencing acts,</hi> which do diſcover him to <hi>live by faith</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> put forth an <hi>act of aſſurance,</hi> when

                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28. hee cryes out, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> yet by our Saviours own teſtimony, verſ. 29. he lives by <hi>ſenſe, Becauſe thou haſt ſeen, thou haſt beleeved;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>Thomas</hi> thou art ſuch a beleever, as doſt live more by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> than by <hi>faith,</hi> thou beleeveſt, but it is becauſe thou <hi>ſeeſt,</hi> thy <hi>faith</hi> can go no further than thy <hi>ſight, but bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have beleeved.</hi> As to ſay, A Chriſtian life there is, whereby a ſoul, though hee ſee nothing, feel nothing, yet <hi>beleeves,</hi> and this is the <hi>bleſſed life,</hi> and thoſe the moſt <hi>bleſſed</hi> which <hi>live</hi> this kinde of <hi>life.</hi> Chriſt here puts beleevers into two ranks, the firſt are thoſe who though they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> yet <hi>live by ſenſe,</hi> grounding their faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething <hi>ſeen;</hi> the ſecond are thoſe who <hi>beleeve and live by faith,</hi> grounding faith upon things not <hi>ſeen. Thomas</hi> is a beleever of the firſt rank, who lived by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and yet had <hi>aſſurance,</hi> ſo that the <hi>act of aſſurance,</hi> is not the <hi>diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act,</hi> betwixt that ſoul which lives by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and hee which lives by <hi>faith:</hi> Yea more, a weak beleever, or a beleever at firſt converſion may, and it is uſual for ſuch to have <hi>acts of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> God coming in ſometimes in a word, or an ordinance, perſwading, and covincing their ſouls of it, that hee is their Father, and Heaven is theirs, yet do not ſuch <hi>live by faith,</hi> for ſo ſoon as this fit or rapture is over (though whilſt it was upon them they would have affirmed it againſt all the Devils in Hell) they call into queſtion, and begin to unſay whatſoever before they ſaid.</p>
               <p>Yea further (as I ſaid before) theſe <hi>acts of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93048:60"/>aſſurance,</hi> though it bee by <hi>beleeving,</hi> I come up to them, yet are they more properly <hi>ſenſe</hi> than <hi>faith,</hi> for when I have <hi>aſſurance,</hi> I cannot ſo well bee ſaid to <hi>hope</hi> for, <hi>beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> as I may in ſome ſort to <hi>ſee, injoy,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſs,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the ſoul oft puts forth <hi>ſuch acts</hi> which lives by <hi>faith,</hi> yet are not theſe they whereby it <hi>lives by faith;</hi> nay more properly hee <hi>lives by faith</hi> when theſe are wanting, for then, and onely then, I put forth pure <hi>acts of faith,</hi> when I have no <hi>ſenſe</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>act of aſſurance</hi> which goes along with that of <hi>adherence,</hi> is not the <hi>act</hi> whereby the ſoul <hi>lives by faith,</hi> but rather a fruit or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of its living by <hi>faith,</hi> it lives by <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>adhering</hi> to the promiſe which is the <hi>firſt act</hi> of faith, and then from this its <hi>adherence</hi> (as a fruit thereof) there is an <hi>aſſurance</hi> of Gods love maintained in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>So that it is clear, that the <hi>act it ſelf,</hi> which is put forth in our <hi>living by faith,</hi> is not an <hi>act of aſſurance,</hi> whereby I am <hi>aſſured</hi> of the love of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but an act of <hi>adherence</hi> or <hi>reliance,</hi> whereby though I ſee or feel nothing at all in mee why I ſhould conclude God loves mee, yet finding that God hath made <hi>promiſes to ſinners,</hi> ſuch as I am, and knowing no juſt or ſufficient ground, why I ſhould exclude my ſelf, I <hi>adhere</hi> to the word and promiſe of God.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>manner of acting,</hi> it is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Conſtantly,</hi> The ſoul which lives by faith, doth not for a <hi>fit and away, reſt, and relye on the promiſe, but conſtantly.</hi> By <hi>conſtantly</hi> I do not mean, that hee doth ſo <hi>reſt</hi> upon the promiſe,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93048:61"/>and <hi>adhere</hi> thereto as that hee never at no time or in no caſe ſtarts aſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf did not ſo cleave to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but once or twice hee did a little ſtep aſide, ſo a ſoul which hath attained the life of <hi>faith,</hi> and lives the ſame, may at ſome times, and in ſome particular caſe ſtep aſide, and act too much in a way of <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by <hi>conſtantly,</hi> I mean thus, <hi>That in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe of his life and actions, he is carried on by faith,</hi> and acts in a way of faith, ſetting aſide now and then ſome particular acts, and the whole of his life and actions, is guided by faith.</p>
               <p>Or if you pleaſe, you may reſtrain it to the <hi>morer part,</hi> though <hi>ſometimes,</hi> and oft hee <hi>acts ſenſe,</hi> yet <hi>moſtly</hi> hee is in <hi>beleeving,</hi> and ſo takes this denomination of <hi>living by faith</hi> from the <hi>greater part,</hi> becauſe hee doth more live by faith, than by ſenſe.</p>
               <p>So that by <hi>conſtantly</hi> I do not underſtand every particular <hi>individual act,</hi> but the <hi>general courſe</hi> of a mans life (when once hee comes to live this life) or the morer part of his actings are in a way of faith.</p>
               <p>Now hereby hee is diſtinguiſhed from all ſuch as reſt and relye upon the promiſe, for a fit onely and away.</p>
               <p>Some there are who will <hi>adhere</hi> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for a <hi>fit</hi> whilſt they finde themſelves ſo and ſo qualified, or have ſuch and ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, manifeſtations of the love, goodneſs, power of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So long as theſe remain, they <hi>adhere</hi> to the promiſe, but ſo ſoon as theſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93048:61"/>are a little decayed, or the ſenſe of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, they are off the hinges, and cannot <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> to the Promiſe any longer; ſo that it is but now and then, rarely, when and whilſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are up, that theſe reſt on the Promiſe, they are five times more off than on; they live ten days in unbelief, for one of faith.</p>
               <p>Some others will <hi>adhere</hi> it may bee, (though they finde none of theſe) to the Promiſe for a <hi>little moment,</hi> and then they look that the thing for which they cleave to this promiſe ſhould inſtantly bee theirs, but finding the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they faint, and <hi>give over adhering;</hi> both theſe are hereby diſtinguiſhed from living by faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Quietly,</hi> i. e. It reſts upon the Promiſes <hi>without murmuring or repining,</hi> though the thing promiſed be delayed, and every day it is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and deſiring the coming thereof; O when will it come! yet it <hi>is quiet,</hi> it doth not ſpeak evil of God, nor of the Promiſe, though it thinks long every day to have the Promiſe fulfilled, yet doth it not think it too long, though the fulfilling thereof bee delayed for a good time, but contents it ſelf herewith, I have a promiſe, though when, or how I ſhall have it fulfilled I know not, when God will give this, do this, or how, I know not, only here I have a promiſe, this <hi>I adhere</hi> to.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſometimes the ſoul may ſay, Whither God will give this to me, I do not certainly know, only here is a promiſe, and I have no reaſon to think the contrary, and therefore I will wait upon him, let him do what ſeemeth him good, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.26. <hi>It is good that a man
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93048:62"/>ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>Habakkuks</hi> Viſion teacheth us, chap. 2.4. <hi>Behold his ſoul which is lifted up is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in him, hut the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> He whoſe heart is lifted up, ſwolne with pride, and impatience, cannot bear Gods delay, but the life of faith teacheth <hi>quietneſs</hi> under this.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>this diſtinguiſheth living by faith,</hi> from that <hi>impatient waiting</hi> of many ſouls, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>repining,</hi> if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be delayed, which was the fault of that wicked King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6, 33. <hi>And he ſaid, behold, this evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Spouſe in <hi>Canticles,</hi> Chapters third and fifth, when her Beloved twice had with-drawn himſelf, and was gone, ſhe <hi>waits</hi> for him, but in an <hi>orderly way,</hi> ſhe doth not lye ſtill ſleeping, and ſlugging upon her bed, and ſay, Well, my beloved is gone for the preſent, but he will come again, but up ſhe gets her, and about the ſtreets ſhe goes, and enquires of every one ſhe meets with, <hi>Saw you him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> ſhee runs to the Watch-men. <hi>O! ſaw you him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> from them to the Daughters of Jeruſalem, <hi>O! ſaw you him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> thus ſhe <hi>waits,</hi> yet is active, uſing means.</p>

               <p n="1">1 From a <hi>careleſs waiting</hi> and reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſe, as to ſay, Well, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſuch a thing, it matters not what I do, God will fulfill his own promiſe, and ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects and throws away all means and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; this is not <hi>living by faith,</hi> but a carnal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and ſecure frame of ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 From a <hi>diſorderly, waiting,</hi> a waiting upon God for a mercy, but a going out of <hi>Gods way</hi> to obtain it, by following ſome <hi>way</hi> of my own or anothers invention, which is not Gods; <hi>Saul</hi> was twice in this, and it coſt him dear, once when he offered a Burnt-offering, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. and when he went to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:93048:63"/>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond thing in living by faith is, <hi>the ground of faith;</hi> A man ſtands as hee hath his footing, ſo faith.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here ſhew in order to the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1 VVhat <hi>is not</hi> the ground of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 VVhat <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is not the ground of faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. <hi>Not duties.</hi> Some beleeve that God loves them becauſe of ſuch and ſuch things done by them, this is not the <hi>ground</hi> of faith in living by faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Not affections.</hi> Some others, though they will not <hi>ground</hi> faith upon a bare <hi>duty</hi> done, yet if they have had <hi>affections</hi> therein, they will <hi>ground</hi> their faith upon thoſe, or theſe and the duty put together. Many a poor ſoul thinks this <hi>duty</hi> is accepted, this prayer ſhall be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ask the reaſon, they can give no other, but their hearts have been warmed, <hi>affections</hi> up therein, they wept much, &amp;c. and ſure ſuch a <hi>duty</hi> cannot but ſpeed, and hence poor ſouls when they finde (as moſtly it proves ſo) their great expectations of this duty come to juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they are ready to caſt off not only their <hi>hope</hi> but <hi>duty,</hi> and every thing elſe; the reaſon of all being this, they go upon a falſe and <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground,</hi> and therefore are ſo mutable in their opinions of themſelves, and what they do. This is not the <hi>ground,</hi> the ſoul which lives by faith goes upon, nay a ſoul will never live by faith (but beleeve one day, and call in queſtion the next) till he is got off this <hi>ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Not Graces:</hi> Some do not make <hi>duties</hi> the <hi>ground</hi> of their faith, and knowing the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93048:63"/>of <hi>affections,</hi> are ſhie of them alſo, who yet upon ſight, or diſcerning of the <hi>graces</hi> of the Spirit in themſelves, will <hi>beleeve:</hi> If they finde in themſelves a ſweet heavenly frame of Spirit, an humble frame of heart, hearts full of love to the brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and make theſe things a <hi>ground</hi> of their faith; but whilſt they do thus, ſure enough they never <hi>live by faith,</hi> for how ordinary a thing is it to ſee theſe to day, or in one duty, and to have them out of ſight to morrow, or in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It may bee to day I have a ſweet heavenly ſpiritual frame of heart, but if I ground my faith upon this, perhaps to morrow I ſhall bee as cold, and carnal, as now I am ſpiritual, and where then will my faith bee? to day my heart is humble, to morrow as proud as now humble; to day I can love my brother, let him do what hee will with me or againſt me, I can forget all, and paſs by all, to morrow I cannot do thus, but my heart will be full of wrath, grudging and revenge againſt him, if I ground my faith on theſe things, where will it be when theſe are wanting, yea when inſtead of finding them, I finde the contrary? Theſe things may <hi>encourage faith,</hi> whilſt it is acting, but I muſt make none of theſe, neither <hi>Duties, Affections,</hi> or <hi>Graces,</hi> nor any thing within me, or done by mee the <hi>ground</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the ground of faith, in living by faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two things are laid down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the <hi>ground</hi> of our faith, viz. <hi>The promiſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93048:64"/>of God,</hi> and <hi>Gods power</hi> to perform the ſame; both which together make up a full and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ground</hi> for the faith of the beleeving ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>The promiſe of God,</hi> the word of <hi>promiſe</hi> is the word of <hi>faith,</hi> or that which our <hi>faith</hi> firſt pitcheth upon in <hi>living by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith</hi> muſt have a word, or it is not able to keep up. Now the word or <hi>promiſe</hi> that <hi>faith</hi> pitcheth upon in inabling of the ſoul to live <hi>by faith,</hi> is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The <hi>naked or bare promiſe,</hi> or, (to ſpeak better) the <hi>Promiſe nakedly conſidered,</hi> without any thing of ours joyned with it.</p>
               <p>If I would live <hi>by faith,</hi> I muſt do thus, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I would <hi>act faith,</hi> ſet by all my duties, affections, graces, and go to the <hi>naked Promiſe,</hi> as though I had never performed duty in my life, had not any affection to any thing good, nor one dram of grace in mee.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Abraham</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith) when he went up the Mount, left the Servants, and Aſſes at the foot, and carried onely <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Son of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> with him; So when any would go up to God by <hi>faith,</hi> we muſt leave all our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs beneath, and carry onely the <hi>promiſe</hi> up with us; for whilſt I joyn any thing of my own with the <hi>promiſe,</hi> making the <hi>promiſe,</hi> as it hath this of my own joyned with it, the ground of my <hi>faith,</hi> ſo ſoon as ever I find a want of theſe things, and have them not to carry, I faulter in beleeving.</p>
               <p>Therefore in living <hi>by faith,</hi> it ought to bee the ſpecial care of every Chriſtian to keep to the bare and <hi>naked promiſe,</hi> looking to it that hee
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93048:64"/>do not joyn any thing with the <hi>promiſe,</hi> which to do, as it is a great evill in it ſelf, ſo hath it this evill attending of it, it throws down <hi>faith,</hi> and hinders the ſoul from living <hi>by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>free or unconditional promiſe.</hi> There are in the Book of God, two ſorts of <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Some <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and without condition, made to the worſt of ſinners, as ſuch.</item>
                  <item>2 Some <hi>Conditional,</hi> made to the Saints du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the graces of the Spirit in them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now, in living <hi>by faith,</hi> I am not to make theſe latter ſort of <hi>promiſes</hi> the ground of <hi>faith,</hi> becauſe the <hi>conditions</hi> required in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in mee but weak and imperfect, and at ſometimes only diſcernable, <hi>faith</hi> cannot take hold of them at all times as it ought to do, to the end I might <hi>live</hi> thereby.</p>
               <p>The former ſort of <hi>promiſes</hi> then, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which are <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and without condition, ſuch as are all the <hi>promiſes</hi> of the New Covenant to us, are the <hi>promiſes</hi> which I muſt make the <hi>ground of faith,</hi> in living by <hi>faith,</hi> I mean thoſe <hi>promiſes</hi> which are made to ſinners as ſuch, theſe are they I muſt <hi>ground</hi> my <hi>faith</hi> upon, for theſe <hi>faith</hi> may alwayes take hold of, but of the other but ſometimes only, becauſe onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>conditions</hi> and qualifications required in them, are diſcernable in the ſoul, though there be alwayes ſufficient <hi>ground</hi> for my <hi>faith</hi> in the <hi>promiſe</hi> made to ſinners, yet not in that which is made to Saints. I can ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelfe a ſinner alwayes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion come to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but ſo I cannot a Saint.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93048:65"/>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The power of God</hi> to perform the ſame is another part of the <hi>ground of faith:</hi> If any ask why I joyn this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>power</hi> or ability of God, together with the <hi>promiſe</hi> in the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the Saints in former ages in acting faith, and living by it, have alwayes had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial eye unto, and been much upheld by the <hi>power</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Wee have two notable <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Abrahams faith,</hi> mentioned by the Holy Ghoſt in the New Teſtament, the firſt is that wee ſpake of before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. which was an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>faith Abraham</hi> put forth in reference to a Son, which God had promiſed him hee ſhould have by his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> in his and <hi>Sarahs</hi> old age, when now in reaſon they were paſt hope of having any, his own body being dead, and <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb dead, and this was before, or about the time of the conception of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 17.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>The other was an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>faith Abraham</hi> put ſorth in reference to Gods fulfilling of this his <hi>promiſe</hi> in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> at that time when the <hi>promiſe</hi> ſeemed to bee dying, God commanding <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to offer up <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Son of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> which wee have recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. and repea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Now in either of theſe, wee finde <hi>Abrahams faith</hi> did <hi>ground</hi> not onely on the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but <hi>power</hi> of God alſo, Rom. 4.21. <hi>And being fully perſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ded that what he had promiſed, hee was able alſo to perform,</hi> Heb. 11.19. <hi>Accounting that God was able to raiſe him up, even from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93048:65"/>
               <p>So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I am perſwaded that hee is able to keep that which I have committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him againſt that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the three Children, Dan. 3.17. <hi>Our God whom wee ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> I finde not onely Saints <hi>grounding</hi> their <hi>faith</hi> on the <hi>power</hi> of God, but the Holy Ghoſt oftentimes laying down the <hi>power</hi> of God, as a great <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>faith</hi> and comfort of Gods people, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. when the Apoſtle had put up many ſpiritual petitions in the behalf of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he concludes, <hi>Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us:</hi> Pitching their <hi>faith</hi> for the obtaining of theſe things on the <hi>ability</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Hee is able to ſave,</hi> — the <hi>ability</hi> of Chriſt to ſave, is laid down as a <hi>ground</hi> for our <hi>faith</hi> in coming to him; the laſt words of the verſe, <hi>Hee ever liveth to make interceſſion,</hi> are but the reaſon of the <hi>ability,</hi> Jude v. 24. <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling.</hi> Saints are comforted againſt fear of falling away becauſe God is <hi>able</hi> to keep from falling, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. aſſured that they ſhall ſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is <hi>able</hi> to make them ſtand, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> layes down this as a <hi>ground</hi> for us to <hi>beleeve</hi> they ſhall bee grafted in again, becauſe God is <hi>able</hi> to graft them in again.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe</hi> I finde diſtruſt of the <hi>ability</hi> of God is in Scripture branded for <hi>unbeleef,</hi> and that of the higheſt nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. v. 19, 20,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93048:66"/>21, 22. <hi>They ſaid, Can God furniſh a table in the wilderneſs? Can hee give bread alſo? Can hee provide fleſh for his people? Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth,</hi> verſ. 22. <hi>Becauſe they beleeved not in God, and truſted not in his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the <hi>promiſe</hi> alone without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>power</hi> of God to perform the ſame, is not a ſufficient <hi>ground</hi> for <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man ſhould <hi>promiſe</hi> me a thouſand pound, I muſt conſider his <hi>ability,</hi> as well as his <hi>promiſe,</hi> before I can upon good <hi>ground</hi> beleeve that ever I ſhall have ſo much of him, for if he be not <hi>able</hi> hee cannot give it, and ſo his <hi>promiſe</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>So, though I have a <hi>promiſe</hi> for ſuch and ſuch a mercy, yet if I do not conſider Gods ability to perform this <hi>promiſe,</hi> as well as the <hi>promiſe,</hi> there will not bee a <hi>ground</hi> ſufficient to make mee beleeve: For what if the heart object, as once <hi>Iſrael</hi> did; True, here is a <hi>promiſe,</hi> but can God <hi>perform</hi> what he <hi>promiſeth?</hi> if the ſoul ſay, Yea he is <hi>able,</hi> then the <hi>power</hi> of God preſently comes into conſideration, and I have that as well as the <hi>promiſe</hi> for the <hi>ground</hi> of my <hi>faith;</hi> if the ſoul cannot beleeve this, That God is <hi>able,</hi> then the <hi>promiſe</hi> alone will not perſwade it, neither indeed can it, and ſo it is not <hi>ground</hi> ſufficient to cauſe it to beleeve for the mercy. So that both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>promiſe</hi> of God, and Gods <hi>power</hi> to perform the ſame, muſt go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to make up the <hi>ground of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I would <hi>act faith,</hi> I muſt firſt go to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and there behold and conſider what
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93048:66"/>God hath freely <hi>promiſed</hi> to ſuch a poor miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature as I am, and work this upon my heart, that this word of God is a truth; when I have done ſo, I am to endeavour to bring up my heart to beleeve the <hi>power of God,</hi> viz. That God is <hi>able</hi> and All-ſufficient to fulfill this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> whatſoever ſeems to bee in the way, or to hinder the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now although we are ready to think, that this is a very caſie thing to beleeve the <hi>power</hi> of God, and that wee have no doubt at all thereabouts, yet aſſuredly it is a moſt hard and difficult thing, and I am perſwaded that the greateſt part of our <hi>unbeleef</hi> ſprings from hence, a diſtruſt or queſtioning of the <hi>power</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>I have known one as confident as another that hee did beleeve the <hi>power</hi> of God, and could not think otherwiſe, who yet, when hee came to follow up his doubts to the firſt head, found it far otherwiſe, that the greater part of them did ariſe hence.</p>
               <p>I have many times thought the queſtion hath been onely thus, <hi>Will</hi> God do this for mee, change this heart, kill this corruption, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and could I bee ſatisfied in this, I have thought all my doubts would bee over, but when I have endeavoured to ſearch to the bottome, I have found the ſtate of the queſtion to bee much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and heard a ſecret whiſpering there, <hi>Can</hi> God do ſuch a thing? <hi>Can</hi> this curſed heart of mine be changed? Is it <hi>poſſible</hi> that ſuch and ſuch corruptions that I have been ſo long contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, and uſed all means againſt, and are yet as ſtrong and lively as ever, ſhould ever bee ſubdued?</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93048:67"/>
               <p>Hence comes our <hi>unbeleef</hi> for a great part of it, therefore would we <hi>live by faith,</hi> as wee muſt keep to the <hi>true ground</hi> which is the <hi>promiſe</hi> of God, and his <hi>power</hi> to perform it, ſo likewiſe to the <hi>full ground, i.e.</hi> we muſt act faith in both, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>And me thinks when I ponder upon this, that the <hi>power</hi> of God, as well as the <hi>promiſe</hi> is the <hi>ground</hi> of our <hi>faith;</hi> I do not at all wonder why there is ſo much <hi>unbeleef,</hi> and ſo little of <hi>the life of faith</hi> in moſt of us, becauſe there is an opinion in all our hearts, that it is a very eaſie thing to <hi>beleeve</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of God (as if we had ſuch abundance of faith, that that which ever hath been, and was from <hi>Abrahams</hi> time to <hi>Pauls,</hi> the higheſt and moſt noble act of <hi>faith</hi> (as if wee read Scripture wee ſhall finde this of <hi>beleeving</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of God ever was and hath been) were eaſieſt to us; as if that which decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtrong in <hi>faith,</hi> were now a thing common) and from taking it for granted wee do the thing, wee take no pains with our hearts hereabouts.

               <p n="3">3 The third thing in our deſcription of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by faith is, <hi>the extent of this living by faith,</hi> it extends it ſelf to <hi>all good,</hi> expected or hoped for; to <hi>all evils</hi> preſent or feared, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the life preſent, or that which is to come.</p>
               <p>The natural way for the obtaining of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, preventing of judgements, its to run to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93048:67"/>our own righteouſneſs, our amending and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but now the Chriſtians way is the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> of this <hi>life of faith,</hi> I obtain <hi>all good</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi> I prevent, or remove <hi>all evill</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the Law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of righteouſneſs;</hi> Wherefore? <hi>Becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> found a want of righteouſneſs, the Law that the Lord gave them by <hi>Moſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them of much ſin and unrighteouſneſs, they ſee themſelves ſinners, the Law terrifies them conſcience gripes them what now do they do? Why ſee, v. 32. preſently they run to the Law, that bids them amend their wayes, do thus and thus, this they do, and yet as far from <hi>obtaining</hi> what they want, or <hi>removing</hi> their fears as ever, becauſe they ſought not in a <hi>way of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> likewiſe, they have the ſame wants and ground of fear the <hi>Jews</hi> had; What do they? Why this they do, They hear a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, a glorious meſſage of one Jeſus Chriſt, which was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> through whoſe death poor ſinners beleeving in him ſhould obtain righteouſneſs and ſalvation; hereupon they preſently diſclaiming any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in themſelves, or any thing they could do, flye to Jeſus Chriſt by faith, and ſo obtain righteouſneſs, verſ. 30. <hi>The Gentiles which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not after righteouſneſs, have attained to righteouſneſs, even the righteouſneſs, which is of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They get their great want ſupplied, their

               </p>
               <p>Thus much of this third thing in the general, in the particulars, it falls to be handled in that queſtion, wherein the life of faith is to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed?</p>

               <p>The VVoman of <hi>Canaan</hi> cometh to Chriſt, and meeteth with one repulſe after another, yet her <hi>faith groweth,</hi> is ſtrengthened; <hi>O woman, great is thy faith.</hi> A ſoul that <hi>liveth by faith,</hi> hee beleeveth for certaine that hee ſhall have ſuch a mercy, when <hi>oppoſition</hi> cometh, hee runs to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the Lord hath <hi>promiſed,</hi> here is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty come in the way, and this is like to be a mercy indeed, the Lord will try me before I have it.</p>

Now ſaith the ſoul, I have no worthineſs, nothing at all, this I do, I cloſe with this Jeſus. I beleeve on him, I lay hold on his righteouſneſs, with this will I go into the Fathers preſence, from this I beleeve I am <hi>accepted.</hi> If I have <hi>acceptance</hi> I beleeve I am <hi>accepted,</hi> not becauſe of theſe, but for Chriſt, when I have none, I beleeve I am <hi>accepted</hi> becauſe of Jeſus Chriſt, His <hi>acceptance</hi> is mine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Hee hath made us accepted in his beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So for the <hi>acceptance</hi> of our duties, Jeſus Chriſt beleeved for mee, hee had a <hi>faith</hi> for Juſtification, though not a juſtification through <hi>faith.</hi> So I beleeve my prayer is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi> becauſe Chriſt prayeth for mee. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth for mee.

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93048:71"/>becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath performed obedience for mee.

The <hi>life of faith</hi> reaſoneth it ſelf in all its reaſonings <hi>to God,</hi> the <hi>life of ſenſe</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth it ſelf <hi>from God:</hi> There is no greater <hi>difference</hi> between a man that liveth by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>ſenſe,</hi> than in the <hi>reaſonings.</hi> Take a ſoul that liveth <hi>by faith,</hi> lay what premiſes you will before him, yet he will draw up arguments to draw himſelf <hi>to God.</hi> Tell him his ſins are great, O then mercy will bee great in pardoning them; <hi>Pardon my ſins, for they are great,</hi> Pſal. 25.11. Tell him afflictions are upon him for his ſins, if ſo, then God is a Father; I do not ſay, Every one that is afflicted, God is a Father to, but I tell you how one that liveth <hi>by faith,</hi> will <hi>reaſon</hi> himſelf <hi>to God</hi> by it, and turn the Devils weapons upon himſelf. If corrected, then a childe; ſo the Apoſtle reaſoneth, <hi>If you endure chaſtiſement, God dealeth with you as with Sons,</hi> Heb. 12.7. Hee maketh it an argument to <hi>reaſon</hi> himſelf to <hi>God.</hi> Whatever you can ſet before him, hee will <hi>reaſon</hi> himſelf <hi>to God</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>Tell it, that it hath no righteouſneſs of its
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93048:73"/>own, O then I have the more need to go to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But a ſoul that liveth <hi>by ſenſe,</hi> lay never ſuch <hi>comforts,</hi> precious truths before him, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſoul would <hi>reaſon</hi> himſelf <hi>Heaven-ward</hi> from, yet hee will <hi>reaſon</hi> himſelf <hi>Hell-ward</hi> by them. Lay never ſo much of the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Chriſt before him, yet hee will from all, <hi>reaſon</hi> himſelf <hi>from God.</hi>

                  <hi>Differen.</hi> 8. The <hi>life of ſenſe</hi> maketh a man <hi>principally induſtrious</hi> in the matters of his <hi>own comfort and ſalvation,</hi> but the <hi>life of faith</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in <hi>Gods glory.</hi> Take a ſoul that <hi>liveth by ſenſe,</hi> the great Query is, What ſhall I do to <hi>bee ſaved?</hi> to attain Jeſus Chriſt, pardon of ſin, aſſurance of pardon? They are good Queſtions, I wiſh all had them. But ſuch a ſoul doth not finde much time for acting <hi>for God,</hi> becauſe all his time is taken up in acting <hi>for himſelf:</hi> how ſhall I do for pardon, to get the love of God? This is uſual in new beginners, and others, ſo long as they <hi>live by ſenſe</hi> as <hi>Peters</hi> Converts, and the Gaoler.</p>
               <p>But a ſoul that <hi>liveth by faith,</hi> is chiefly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious</hi> for <hi>Gods glory:</hi> this we may ſee in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though hee was not careleſs of his <hi>ſalvation,</hi> yet hee doth ſeem to overlook it, ſet it by, 2 Tim. 1, 11, 12. <hi>Whereunto I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Preacher, and an Apoſtle, and a Teacher of the Gentiles, for the which cauſe I alſo ſuffer theſe things, nevertheleſs I am not aſhamed, for I know whom I have beleeved, and I am perſwaded he is able to keep that which I have committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him againſt that day.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I am
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93048:73"/>ſo taken up with the <hi>work of God,</hi> of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and building up poor ſouls, that I run all hazards, ſuffer all things for the Elects ſake.</p>
               <p>O but will ſome ſay, <hi>Paul,</hi> what will you do for your ſelf, for your own ſoul? Will you leave that at ſixe and ſevens? O no, I would no have you think ſo, this I do, <hi>I commit that to God;</hi> I ſay, Lord do thou take the care of the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of a poor creature, Lord I commit that to thee, and truſt that with thee, I deſire to do thy work.</p>
               <p>Rom. 9. v. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c. I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lie not, my conſcience alſo bearing mee witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, that I have great heavineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſorrow in my heart; for I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my brethren, my kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> How exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly is hee carried out after the converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; it wil be a glorious time, <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo deſirous of it, that God might have much glory, that he ſeemeth to forget himſelf. If the <hi>Jews</hi> be called, the whole world ſhall bee filled with the glory of God; and I did not care what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of me, though I were <hi>accurſed.</hi> And that the Apoſtle meaneth as he ſaid, that hee did prefer the <hi>glory of God</hi> (which hee ſaw ſhould have much advantage by the converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi>) before his <hi>own ſalvation,</hi> the Apoſtle aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it with many circumſtances <hi>[I ſay the truth, and lye not, my conſcience bearing mee witneſs.]</hi> Surely hee cometh to utter ſome ſtrange thing, that few will credit, therefore hee ſaith, <hi>I ſpeak the truth,</hi> which clearly argueth that the Apoſtle
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93048:74"/>was to ſpeak ſome ſtrange thing, that they that ſhould read or hear, would hardly beleeve it was true. So a ſoul that <hi>liveth by faith,</hi> is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <hi>induſtrious</hi> about the <hi>glory of God.</hi> I do not ſpeak it as that I have attained, but that the Saints, as <hi>Paul,</hi> had attained.</p>
               <p>I come now to the next Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Wherein is this life of Faith to bee exerciſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In handling of this I ſhall ſhew,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What are the things themſelves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts faith is to be exerciſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Concerning this, I told you in general, that this <hi>living by faith,</hi> extends it ſelf as far and wide, as our <hi>neceſſities, wants, fears,</hi> or <hi>doubts,</hi> ſtretch themſelves, to all <hi>good expected</hi> and hoped for, to all <hi>evil preſent</hi> or <hi>feared,</hi> for the procuring of the one, and the averting, or removing of the other; in ſo large a field ſhould I gather up all particulars, I might tire my ſelfe and you. I ſhall therefore draw things into as narrow a compaſs as conveniently I can.</p>
               <p>This phraſe of <hi>living by faith;</hi> I do not finde in all the Scripture to bee uſed but five times, once in the Old Teſtament, as <hi>Han.</hi> 2.4. and four times in the New, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Chap. 3.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. Now in theſe five places it is taken (as it ſeems to me) four ſeveral wayes.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:93048:74"/>
               <p n="1">1 As it relates to a Chriſtians <hi>Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 1.17. <hi>For therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> The great ſcope of the eleven firſt Chapters is, to prove <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith</hi> in Chriſt, againſt thoſe that did hold <hi>Justification by works</hi> of the Law? he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down his poſition in this cauſe, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hee doth oppoſe <hi>Juſtification</hi> by Faith, to <hi>Juſtification</hi> by the Law, Gal. 3.11. <hi>But that no man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, it is evident, For the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As it relates to a Chriſtians <hi>Sanctification,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in mee, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved mee, and gave himſelf for mee.</hi> Though the main argument here is <hi>Juſtification,</hi> yet this <hi>living by faith,</hi> is in reſpect of <hi>Sanctification</hi> chiefly at leaſt, which I think the ſcope of the place yeelds; for <hi>Paul</hi> having verſ. 19. laid down this as an argument why a beleever cannot be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the Law, becauſe hee is <hi>dead</hi> to it, that hee might give a reaſon of this likewiſe, why a beleever is <hi>dead</hi> to the Law, or muſt needs be ſo, he glides off from the main argument of <hi>Juſtification</hi> into this of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as by the by, <hi>[that I might live to God]</hi> What is that? Why, perform obedience now to God, or bring forth fruit to God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. v. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Wherefore my Brethren, yee alſo are become dead to the Law, by the body of Chriſt, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93048:75"/>yee ſhould bee married to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that wee ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which argument being now digreſſed into, hee proſecutes in the next verſe, wherein as is clear, hee goes on to ſpeak of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> for hee ſpeaks of Chriſts <hi>living</hi> in him, which is not our <hi>Juſtification</hi> that is by Chriſt <hi>without us,</hi> and ſo his <hi>living by faith</hi> is to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in reſpect of that, <hi>viz. Sanctification,</hi> which in the former verſe, and beginning of this, hee was ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As it relates to a Chriſtians <hi>Expectation,</hi> or waiting; So <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.4. <hi>For the Viſion is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it ſhall ſpeake, and not lye: Though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry; Behold his ſoule which is lifted up, is not upright in him; But the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> Speaking of the <hi>Viſion</hi> delayed, hee ſaith, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith, i.e.</hi> expect the coming thereof, and wait for it in a way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
               <p n="4">4 As it relates to a Chriſtians <hi>perſeverance.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Which words, if you compare them with the foregoing verſe, ſeem to bee of the ſame ſenſe with them in <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> to bee ſpoken of a life of <hi>expectation,</hi> verſ. 37. <hi>For yet a little while and hee that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry; Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> — But compared with the following words, in this, and the next verſe, they concern <hi>perſeverance,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93048:75"/>becauſe in this verſe <hi>drawing back</hi> is ſet in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>living by faith;</hi> and again, verſ. 39. <hi>But we are not of them who draw back unto perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of them that beleeve, to the ſaving of the ſoul.</hi> Beleeving is ſet in oppoſition to drawing back.</p>

               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How doth faith act, or what is it that faith doth (in thoſe perſons which live by faith) as touching either of theſe things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In order to which I ſhall <hi>premiſe</hi> this word; That I ſhall not go about to preſcribe any one way or order that the Spirit of God (while it enables a ſoul to <hi>live by faith</hi> in either of theſe) walks in, or works in, ſo as to tye up all Saints to that way or manner of working, which experience teacheth to be dangerous, and to adminiſter matter of ſtumbling to poore ſouls; for as the Wiſdome of God in his VVord is manifold, ſo the workings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in the hearts of the faithful, through which they are enabled to <hi>live by faith,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold and various, though in the ſubſtance all agreeing.</p>
               <p>As in our Juſtification, ſo in all the reſt, one is enabled to <hi>live by faith</hi> herein, from ſuch a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93048:76"/>principle, another from ſuch a principle; yea the ſame perſon looking upon himſelf at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, ſhall finde that one while his <hi>faith</hi> ſprings from one principle or conſideration, another while from another.</p>
               <p>As for example, perhaps to day I beleeve my <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and go on <hi>beleeving</hi> it for a week or a moneth together, from ſuch a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this, <hi>viz. God hath made a Covenant with me in his Son, and this is unchangeable,</hi> as not made upon condition of my obedience, ſo no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> broken by my diſobedience; and hence I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> I am juſtified.</p>
               <p>Another while perhaps this principle is not ſo lively and vigorous as to keep up my <hi>faith,</hi> but then another doth it, as this, <hi>God juſtifies the ungodly,</hi> now ſaith the ſoul, though I cannot ſay I am a Saint, yet this I can ſay, I am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly one, well. God <hi>juſtifies</hi> the ungodly, this is a precious truth, I own it, I cleave to it, I am an ungodly one, a Sinner, <hi>I beleeve God juſtifies</hi> me. VVhen this hath kept up <hi>faith</hi> a while, then it may be the life and vigour of this goes off the heart too; and then come another, as this, <hi>The righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by which poor ſinners are juſtified, is a <hi>perfect compleat righteouſneſs;</hi> this righteouſneſs is given to thoſe that <hi>beleeve,</hi> to ſuch he becomes <hi>the Lord their righteouſneſs.</hi> I am a poore Sinner, of my own I have no <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> this I do, I cleave to his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> which is <hi>perſect,</hi> and able fully to juſtifie my poor ſoul; and I do in ſome meaſure beleeve that I have a ſhare in <hi>this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> it is mine, and that I am thereby <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi> in the ſight of God.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93048:76"/>
               <p>Theſe Principles (with many others) though diverſe in themſelves, yet do they ſweetly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the maine, all leading the ſoul to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without for juſtification.</p>
               <p>And truly, this <hi>premiſal</hi> is very neceſſary and material, for how ordinary is it with poor ſouls, if ſo be their <hi>faith</hi> hath been carried out from ſuch a principle, and they hear another in relating his experience hath been carried out from another, to queſtion the truth of their own, at leaſt to have ſome jealouſies about it, yea ſome poor ſouls are ſometimes ready to ſtagger, when they look upon themſelves, and conſider the laſt moneth, or the laſt year, I had much ſtrength and ability <hi>to beleeve</hi> from ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, now do I not finde that at all inabling me, but the <hi>faith</hi> I had is from another, how comes this to paſs? VVhy am I ſo inconſtant in my <hi>faith?</hi> true or not? for (my brethren) we are prone and ready to think when from any one principle or conſideration, our <hi>faith</hi> is kept up, that that ſhould do it ever, which is our weakneſs and ignorance, to ſhew us which may be one reaſon why God deals in this way with us, as another to make us ſee his manifold work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in every of which hee is glorious, and therefore in none to be deſpiſed, and alſo to make us have a higher eſteem of every truth, not to ſlight any jot of the Goſpel; and laſtly, which is the thing <hi>premiſed,</hi> to teach us that we ſhould not tye up God to any one way or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working, ſaying, here he goes, in this way he works, and in no other. This being <hi>premiſed,</hi> I come to the queſtion, to ſhew <hi>how faith acts</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:93048:77"/>(in ſuch as <hi>live by faith</hi>) or what it doth in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe.</p>

                  <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, <hi>Faith looks ſtrictly and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to the conſcience: Conſcience</hi> is the ſtrong hold and caſtle of the ſoul, whilſt that is quiet &amp; free from tumults, the whole man is at peace, let there be a tumult there, and the whole man is at war and put into diſtraction, therefore <hi>faith</hi> in the buſineſs of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> makes the ſoul to uſe all diligence of ſecure that hold out of the hands of the enemy, by ſecuring which, the whole man injoyes peace; and truly this look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, and ſecuring of <hi>conſcience</hi> is a buſineſs of greateſt concernment, in <hi>living by faith</hi> for <hi>juſtification;</hi> For the Devill and Sin, do the ſoul more miſchief when theſe get into <hi>conſcience,</hi> than they do, or can do any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>Now there are three wayes by which <hi>Faith ſecures Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 By <hi>putting a ſtrong garriſon into Conſcience and keeping it there:</hi> This <hi>ſtrong Garriſon</hi> is the <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt, which <hi>faith</hi> brings into <hi>conſcience,</hi> and keeps there: <hi>Faith</hi> knows that nothing elſe can defend <hi>conſcience,</hi> when Sin and Satan ſtorm it, but Chriſt <hi>Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:93048:84"/>Hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. wee are ſaid to have the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; for the Reſurrection being the time wherein Chriſt did appear in all his <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and ſhew forth himſelf as one that had now fulfilled <hi>all Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and upon the very ſame account was now riſen from the dead, when hee had been acting the laſt part of that ſad Tragedy as to himſelf, but glorious work of <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> as to us, is put for the <hi>whole Righteouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt both active and paſſive, and ſo it is as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, The <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt being put into our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> is that whereby they are ſecured and kept peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo that inſtead of tumults and inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>conſcience,</hi> our <hi>conſciences</hi> are in peace, inſtead of accuſing us, wee have the anſwer of a <hi>good conſcience</hi> towards God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 By <hi>clearing the conſcience of all thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who formerly have done, or do diſturb the peace thereof:</hi> As <hi>faith</hi> brings a <hi>ſtrong garriſon</hi> into <hi>conſcience,</hi> ſo it <hi>ejects</hi> all malignants or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of <hi>conſciences</hi> peace; theſe are thoſe <hi>dead works,</hi> Heb 9.14. which creep into <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, i. e.</hi> the guilt of all ſin, whether of omiſſion or commiſſion, which get into <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and diſturb its peace. Now <hi>faith</hi> garriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>conſcience with</hi> Chriſts <hi>righteouſneſſe, ejects</hi> all theſe; the firſt thing this garriſon doth, being entred, is the clenſing of the place where it is, from all ſuch as are <hi>enemies</hi> to the <hi>peace</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever guilt of ſin, paſt, or preſent, which lyes in the conſcience, and wrangles, all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93048:85"/>is caſt out, the <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt being made governor of <hi>conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>conſcience</hi> injoyes abundance of <hi>peace;</hi> whereas before it had not quiet an hour in a day, many times for a month together, now it is full of <hi>peace;</hi> Sin which before lay gnawing and tormenting it, is now caſt out, and <hi>everlaſting righteouſneſſe</hi> comes in the room thereof, whereby the ſoul poſſeſſeth abundance of <hi>inward peace</hi> paſſing all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. O ſaith the ſoul, I never knew what a calm was till now, that I had the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt ſet up in my <hi>conſcience.</hi> I have been oftentimes toſſed too and fro, and my ſoul neer upon ſhipwrack, but now thanks bee to God, I injoy a bleſſed calme, I never knew what a calme of <hi>conſcience</hi> was till now, Therefore my heart rejoyceth, my tongue is glad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 By <hi>keeping a conſtant guard at the gates of conſcience, that ſo theſe enemies being caſt out, may not re-enter; Faith</hi> knowing of how great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment it is, keeps a <hi>guard</hi> day and night at the <hi>gate of conſcience,</hi> ſo as that, when any of the ejected enemies would <hi>re-enter,</hi> preſently they are under examination, Who is here? Who are yee? Who are you for? Why, I am ſuch a one; Then ſtand, Stand off, come not here, this is the <hi>Garriſon</hi> Chriſts <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and here is ſtrict command no ſuch muſt enter, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it his exerciſe to keep <hi>conſcience</hi> clear, though hee could not but faile in his duty towards God and man both, yet hee exerciſeth himſelf to keep his <hi>conſcience</hi> clear, to keep it void of offence, that though offences were committed, yet that the guilt of them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93048:85"/>might not get in there. And thus much for the firſt thing, how Faith acts, or what it doth in perſons living thereby, in our <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Wherein doth lye the advantage of that ſoul that liveth by faith in Juſtification, above another that concludeth his Juſtification from ſenſe, from what he ſeeth and feeleth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He hath an advantage <hi>in reſpect of the ground upon which he holdeth his Juſtification;</hi> when wee hold a thing upon <hi>good ground,</hi> if of worth, the greater advantage we have.</p>
                  <p>The ſoule that liveth by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> holdeth his <hi>Juſtification</hi> upon a <hi>ground</hi> within him, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſenſible workings, that is his <hi>ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a ſoul that liveth by <hi>faith,</hi> holdeth his <hi>Juſtification</hi> upon a <hi>ground</hi> without him, the Promiſe and Covenant of God, this is a better <hi>ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 In regard of the <hi>clearneſs of the ground,</hi> it is ſuch a <hi>ground,</hi> as doth more <hi>clearly</hi> repreſent the thing, than any other thing can. I may more <hi>clearly</hi> ſee and behold my <hi>juſtification</hi> in the Promiſe, than in any experience whatever. That ſoule that <hi>grounds</hi> upon <hi>ſenſe,</hi> there is a veile many times upon his <hi>juſtification,</hi> becauſe there is a veile many times upon his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; upon <hi>Moſes</hi> face there was a veile: So when the <hi>ground</hi> of our <hi>juſtification</hi> runs in a legal way, upon <hi>ſenſe,</hi> there will be a veile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Juſtification,</hi> for the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> is veiled.</p>
                  <p>A man that hath a veil upon his face, you ſee his face but darkly, if you ſee it at all, you ſee it with a great deal of uncertain knowledge; but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93048:86"/>now that ſoul that <hi>grounds</hi> his <hi>Juſtification</hi> upon the promiſe, that man ſeeth his <hi>Juſtification</hi> as a man ſeeth another face to face, <hi>i. e.</hi> hee ſeeth <hi>clearly,</hi> and ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced to ſee Chriſts day, and ſaw it, he ſaw it <hi>clearly;</hi> now how did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſee the day of Chriſt? He had many expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, he did not ſee the day of Chriſt through theſe, but through the Promiſe, for ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> he ſaw through the promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is a <hi>ſure ground;</hi> it is good to be upon <hi>ſure ground,</hi> even in ſmaller things than this upon which a mans eternal Salvation doth hang. As a mans <hi>Juſtification</hi> is a thing of ſuch moment, therefore we had need to bee upon <hi>ſure ground.</hi> Now that ſoul which holds his <hi>Juſtification</hi> from any thing within, doth not hold it upon a <hi>ſure ground;</hi> it may be hee hath experience to day, and its gone the next day; ſometimes it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſometimes abſent; but the promiſe is a <hi>ſure ground;</hi> Why, becauſe that remaineth.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul that holdeth its <hi>Juſtification</hi> upon any thing within, will at one time or other let go his hold of <hi>Juſtification;</hi> but that ſoul that holds it upon the promiſe without, will hold it when the other lets it go.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is a <hi>ground more eaſily come by;</hi> our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences it is hard to keep them when we have them; ſo, hard to regain them when loſt.</p>
                  <p>Hard to get an humble frame of heart, but harder to regain when loſt; but the <hi>promiſe</hi> is more eaſie, though it have no experience for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93048:86"/>the preſent, yet a poor ſoul may take his Bible, and go to the <hi>promiſe</hi> of God, and lay hold of that.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay, it is as hard to lay hold of the promiſe, as to get up experiences?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We grant it is ſo; but the <hi>promiſe</hi> is the <hi>ground,</hi> it is not our laying hold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Its a <hi>ground that hath a great deal leſs deceit in it;</hi> when a man <hi>grounds</hi> upon any thing within, there is a great deal of <hi>deceit;</hi> as the Spirit of God hath his true Gold, ſo the Devil hath his gilded Counters, therefore poſſibly I may miſs, and take the Devils gilded Counters for the Spirits gold; but in the <hi>promiſe</hi> there is not that <hi>deceit,</hi> that is a <hi>ground</hi> that a ſoul ſhall not be <hi>deceived</hi> by. So there is advantage in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 That ſoul that liveth by faith in <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> hath an advantage in this reſpect, <hi>in that the ſoul hath its juſtification more conſtantly in its ſight than another hath;</hi> another ſees it now and then, but he beholds it more <hi>conſtantly.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By having our <hi>juſtification</hi> more <hi>conſtantly</hi> in our ſight, we are free from <hi>abundance of thoſe doubts and fears that other poor ſouls are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hurried about withall about their juſtification:</hi> take a poor ſoul that liveth by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and hee is in continual <hi>fears</hi> about this <hi>Juſtification,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually toſſed too and fro; one while hee think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſurely I am not that <hi>juſtified</hi> perſon, if I were, there would not be ſo many ſins ſtirring: another thinks, ſurely I am not <hi>juſtified,</hi> for I have rejected Chriſt ſo many time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before, and had ſo many heart-warmings in his Word, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93048:87"/>all gone, ſo that he is continually in a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of <hi>fears and doubts,</hi> that hee cannot wind himſelf out of, about his <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a poor ſoul that hath his <hi>Juſtification</hi> in his ſight, is freed from <hi>abundance</hi> of theſe <hi>fears,</hi> is not toſſed too and fro, but beholdeth his <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> grounded on the rock without him.</p>
                  <p>Though hee findeth not that within that hee hath found, and breathes after, yet ſaith the poor ſoul, <hi>my Juſtification</hi> is by a <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> without, though I prize the workings of the Spirit of God within, above any thing this world can afford; and though I finde a want of theſe, yet I will not conclude I am not <hi>juſtified,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>juſtification</hi> is all without; I may be <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> yea I beleeve I am, though I finde not theſe workings ſo lively and ſtirring, as time hath been they have; ſo he is free from <hi>fears</hi> in the buſineſs of his <hi>juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The conſtant holding our Juſtification in our ſight, <hi>maketh the ſoul take all the dealings of God in good part, put a good conſtruction upon all Gods dealings,</hi> whereas another who is dark in <hi>juſtification,</hi> he can take no <hi>dealing</hi> in <hi>good part</hi> at the hand of God. A ſoul that beholdeth his <hi>juſtification,</hi> can, as long as that is clear, behold the love of God in Chriſt towards it, it can put a <hi>good conſtruction</hi> upon all. Let God give a mercy, he will ſay, that it is out of love; let God take away a mercy, he will ſay, that is out of love. Let God ſmile, he ſeeth his love; let God frown, through his frown he beleeveth his love. Let God put him into a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſeeth love; let him put him into an
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93048:87"/>afflicted, adverſe condition, he can beleeve God is his God.</p>
                  <p>But take a poor ſoul that is <hi>dark</hi> in that, let him give a mercy, he ſaith, O, I am affraid it is in Judgement; let him take away a mercy, this is in judgement, I have abuſed it. Let God ſmile, he is affraid to own it, leſt hee be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; let God put him into proſperity, he thinks that will ruine him, into affliction, he thinketh that is to deſtroy him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The conſtant beholding our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> doth <hi>carry out a ſoul with a ſweet Son-like frame of Spirit, in all its actings towards God:</hi> Take a ſoul that is <hi>dark</hi> in its <hi>juſtification,</hi> there will not bee childe-like actings, but ſlaviſh actings: a ſpirit of bondage, ſervile actings: But take a ſoul that hath his <hi>juſtification</hi> in his <hi>eye,</hi> and there will bee ſweet Son-like actings, when hee goeth to duty, hee goeth with the ſpirit of a Son: I ſee Hell is gone, Heaven is given, and doth not perform duty to avoid the one, or procure the other, but doth all as to a Father, becauſe God hath taken Hell away, and given Heaven, and is my Father, therefore I go about the work of God. When it mourneth for ſin, it doth not mourn for fear it ſhould bee Damned, but becauſe it hath ſinned againſt a Father: I do not ſay it is ſo with a Saint at all times; but when a ſoul <hi>beholdeth</hi> its <hi>juſtification,</hi> ſo it is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 This conſtant beholding our <hi>juſtification</hi> doth <hi>diſ-inamour and wean the heart from worldly things;</hi> our hearts are never ſo <hi>weaned</hi> from the <hi>Creature,</hi> as when wee ſee through <hi>juſtification</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93048:88"/>our intereſt in the Creator. When the poor ſoul cometh to ſee the great God of Heaven and Earth is my Father, and I have a glorious inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance provided above in Heaven for me; then it ſaith, Why ſhould I dote upon <hi>Creatures?</hi> As a Princes Son is eſtranged from the company of other Children; why? I am the Princes Son, they are companions below me, this maketh him leave other Boys, and not play with them; ſo a Princes Son wil not go and hoard up Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, why? I am a Princes Son: ſo a poor ſoul when it beholdeth its <hi>juſtification</hi> is eſtranged from the world, upon this conſideration; I am a Son of God, a Childe of God, have an intereſt in Heaven, a glorious inheritance there, and this weaneth the heart from the world. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding our actual <hi>juſtification</hi> begets ſuch actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſiderations as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>It armeth us against all Satans temptations;</hi> it puts the ſoul into ſuch a condition as it can grapple with Satan, when he cometh to aſſault it with his <hi>fiery darts;</hi> let the Devil ſhoot never ſo many <hi>fiery darts,</hi> yet ſo he hath his <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in his <hi>eye,</hi> it will keep off all, and therefore it is called a <hi>Shield.</hi> They uſed a <hi>Shield</hi> to repel <hi>Arrows</hi> from the party; <hi>Faith</hi> is our <hi>ſhield</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the <hi>darts</hi> of Satan, and beat them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſo this is another advantage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That ſoul that liveth by faith in <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is delivered from the <hi>great evil other ſouls run into, of adding to, or detracting from his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> it is a <hi>great evil</hi> incident to the Saints, they look upon themſelves as more or leſs <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> accordingly as they are more or leſs <hi>holy,</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:93048:88"/>and their works more or leſs ſpiritual. I do not ſay but that we ſhould endeavour after <hi>holineſs,</hi> and ſpirituality to the utmoſt; but not to make our <hi>juſtification</hi> leſs or more, as theſe things are leſſe or more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>it puts our juſtification as a ſtock into our own hands, that by our care and diligence wee might augment, or by careleſneſs and negligence might diminiſh it:</hi> whereas our <hi>juſtification</hi> is a <hi>ſtock</hi> the Saints <hi>have,</hi> but it is in the <hi>hands</hi> of their <hi>Suerty,</hi> which though they are, and ought to uſe all Chriſtian <hi>care and diligence,</hi> yet by all their <hi>care and diligence,</hi> there is not one dram added to their <hi>juſtification.</hi> Though they are to take heed of all careleſneſs, and remiſneſs, and avoyd them, yet though they ſhould fail, there is not one whit, not one dram taken away from their <hi>juſtification</hi> by all. <hi>Juſtification</hi> is as the Childes Portion in the <hi>Executors hands;</hi> the Childe hath ſome ſpending-money, but his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the <hi>hands</hi> of the <hi>Executor.</hi> So is our <hi>juſtification,</hi> that is a <hi>ſtock</hi> in the <hi>hands</hi> of our <hi>Executor;</hi> the Saints have ſomething in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they ſpend much of that, but they would ſpend their <hi>juſtification</hi> too, if the <hi>ſtock</hi> were in their <hi>own hand:</hi> but it is in the <hi>hands</hi> of their <hi>Suerty, Executor,</hi> and they cannot ſpend that; he will not let them have that, ſo that, that cannot be ſpent. Now when we look upon our <hi>juſtification</hi> as that which may be <hi>added to,</hi> or <hi>detracted from,</hi> we do not look upon it as in the <hi>hands</hi> of our <hi>Suerty,</hi> but in our <hi>own hands,</hi> and that is a <hi>great evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is a great evil, becauſe <hi>it maketh our
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93048:89"/>Juſtification like our Sanctification, in part:</hi> for that which is <hi>perfect</hi> can have nothing <hi>added to it,</hi> or <hi>taken from it;</hi> if any thing could be <hi>added to it,</hi> then it was not <hi>perfect</hi> before; perfection doth neither admit of addition or diminution. Now our <hi>Juſtification</hi> is <hi>perfect,</hi> by <hi>one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. them the Father hath ſet apart, he hath <hi>perfected</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now if I ſhould be more juſtified at one time than at another, then <hi>Juſtification</hi> were not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>It maketh juſtifying grace to depend upon Creature actings;</hi> for if I am more juſtified when I do more, and leſs when I do leſs; then my actings have influence into my <hi>juſtification,</hi> and ſo <hi>juſtification</hi> depends upon <hi>Creature act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and ſo if of works; then it is no more of grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a great evil, becauſe <hi>it doth much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt;</hi> it ſpeaketh the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt <hi>inſufficient</hi> for our <hi>juſtification;</hi> if the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to <hi>juſtification,</hi> then all I can do cannot help it forward. If it need any thing of ours, then it is not <hi>ſufficient</hi> of it ſelf, I ſpeak this to ſhew the <hi>great evil</hi> of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to,</hi> or <hi>detracting from juſtification;</hi> which how uſual it is to look upon our ſelves more juſtified at one time than another, experience teacheth; as if there were a flaw in our <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> ſo ſoon as there is a flaw or ſlip in our converſation. I ſhall come now to ſpeak a few words to the third thing.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>What is it that hindreth the ſoul
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93048:89"/>from living by faith in juſtification?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Our being ignorant of the nature of that diſpenſation we are under, through grace;</hi> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the nature of Goſpel Diſpenſations, therefore it is wee live ſo little by faith. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is an adminiſtration of <hi>Grace,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> but <hi>grace,</hi> pure <hi>grace,</hi> all in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is <hi>grace</hi> from firſt to laſt. Now wee being <hi>ignorant</hi> of this <hi>Goſpel Diſpenſation,</hi> we are led by the Principles of old <hi>Adam</hi> within us, to look upon the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as a <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> or at leaſt as partly <hi>grace,</hi> and partly <hi>works,</hi> and when we look upon it ſo, we think wee cannot have <hi>juſtification</hi> by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> unleſs we bring ſomething with us, and this hinders <hi>living by faith,</hi> beleeving for <hi>juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The principles of old <hi>Adam</hi> do ſo agree with the Covenant made on <hi>Sinai,</hi> that we can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome go out to God for <hi>justification,</hi> but are ready to look upon God as ſtanding upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſtanding upon that Covenant, and then we ſee an angry God, a terrible God, a God cloathed with Thundrings and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and that makes us think wee muſt bring ſomething to God to pacifie him, and ſo wee are hindred from <hi>living by faith</hi> in <hi>juſtification.</hi> Whereas a poor ſoul when it cometh to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it but <hi>grace,</hi> but pure <hi>grace,</hi> then the ſoul can act <hi>faith</hi> for <hi>juſtification,</hi> and go out to God for it, as a poor nothing-Creature, when it ſeeth all is received in a way of <hi>grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Fear we ſhould preſume if we ſhould go to God for Juſtification as poor nothing-creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> O thinks
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93048:90"/>the ſoul, If I ſhould goe to God as having <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> I ſhould <hi>preſume,</hi> this maketh him <hi>afraid</hi> to go to the <hi>Promiſe:</hi> Whereas indeed wee do <hi>preſume</hi> in not going.</p>
                  <p>If a great man <hi>promiſe</hi> a poor man a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, and tell him he ſhall have it, if hee come for it; if this poor man ſhould be ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly as to ſay, I will not go, if I had it I ſhould bee glad, but for ſuch a poor man in my rags to go to ſuch a great man, I ſhould <hi>preſume,</hi> would it not bee <hi>preſumption</hi> for him not to go?</p>
                  <p>So it is a great <hi>preſumption</hi> for a poor ſinner not to go to God for <hi>juſtification</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi> Is it not high <hi>preſumption</hi> to pull down that, God hath ſet up, and ſet up that, God hath pulled down? When a ſuperior Court ſets up a Law, for an inferior to repeal it; When the High Court of Parliament hath repealed a Law, for an inferior Court to go and enact that Law, were it not <hi>preſumption?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Law God hath ſet up, that all ſhould have <hi>juſtification by grace,</hi> that is repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have <hi>juſtification by works.</hi> When I ſhall go ſeek to bee <hi>juſtified</hi> by ſomething within mee, or done by mee, I doe goe, and ſet up that <hi>Law</hi> that God hath aboliſhed, and is not this <hi>high preſumption?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>The old Adam ſticking cloſe to us.</hi> When wee ſpeak of <hi>old Adam ſticking cloſe,</hi> I do not ſo much mean, the <hi>Evil old Adam,</hi> as <hi>Good old Adam,</hi> Moral <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which was in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Liquor that is firſt put into a veſſel, the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93048:90"/>veſſel will hold the ſent of that longeſt: Now man was <hi>righteous</hi> before <hi>ſinful;</hi> old <hi>Adam</hi> was made <hi>firſt righteous,</hi> therefore it is <hi>more natural</hi> for a man to think to bee ſaved by his owne <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> than to <hi>ſin:</hi> Though to <hi>ſin</hi> be <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> the other <hi>more natural,</hi> for it is more rooted in nature than ſin.</p>
                  <p>And it plainly appeareth that it is an eaſier thing to bring a man off from <hi>any ſin,</hi> than from the opinion of his <hi>own righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To bring a Drunkard from his drunkenneſs, a Swearer from his ſwearing, eaſier, than from an opinion that his own <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſhould ſave him.</p>
                  <p>And it is clearly ſhewed, many a man is brought off from his <hi>ſin,</hi> that is never brought off from his <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> therefore that ſticks cloſer. And this wee may ſee if wee look on the Scribes and Phariſees, and Publicans and Harlots. The Scribes and Phariſees were thoſe that ſtuck cloſe to <hi>Good old Adam,</hi> to walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and <hi>righteouſly:</hi> The Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, were thoſe that minded neither good, nor evill, but ſwimmed in all the <hi>evill</hi> of <hi>old Adam:</hi> Now, when Chriſt came, they imbraced and entred into Heaven, but the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, the <hi>righteous</hi> men, that were following the <hi>good of old Adam,</hi> they reject Chriſt, and run headlong to Hell.</p>
                  <p>And this likewiſe is clear, if you look to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Apoſtles time. The <hi>Jews</hi> followed after <hi>good old Adam;</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> they went on in <hi>ſinful old Adam:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> they rejected Chriſt, oppoſed Chriſt; The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93048:91"/>they come in and imbrace Chriſt. So that the <hi>good of old Adam</hi> ſticks more cloſe than <hi>ſin;</hi> and there is many a man is come off from his <hi>ſin,</hi> that wil be damned for his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> truſting to that, neglecting Chriſts <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees were come off from ſinne, and the <hi>Jews</hi> did not live in that unrighteous way. Publicans and Harlots did, yet theſe goe headlong to Hell, and the other imbrace Chriſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>Sanctification</hi> conſiſts of two parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Vivification.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mortification</hi> is the deſtroying of the old man, <hi>Vivification</hi> is the <hi>quickning</hi> of the new man.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Mortification</hi> conſiſts of two branches. There is the <hi>mortification</hi> of the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>outward man,</hi> that is, of all thoſe things that <hi>pleaſe the carnal outward ſenſe and appetite;</hi> and of the <hi>inward man,</hi> of all the <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers of the ſoul,</hi> will, and affections, Col. 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanneſs;</hi> the <hi>mortification</hi> of the <hi>outward man:</hi> And in verſ. 8. <hi>Put off all theſe, anger, wrath, malice, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</hi> — There is the <hi>mortification</hi> of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</hi>

The laſt comes from the former. Our Graces bring forth our Duties, and our Duties are but the <hi>actings</hi> of our Graces.</p>
                  <p>So that the things wee are to <hi>live by faith</hi> in,

                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How doth faith act or put forth it ſelf in this buſineſs of</hi> Sanctification?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here according to the <hi>two parts,</hi> wee ſhall proceed, and ſhew how faith acts in the buſineſs of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Vivification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>How doth faith act in the buſineſs</hi> of <hi>Mortification?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Faith</hi> doth diſcover to the ſoul, <hi>that the old man,</hi> the unregenerate, and unmortified part that is in every one of us, <hi>was carried up by the Lord Jeſus upon the Croſs, and there did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a deadly wound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer and ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did take upon him <hi>that nature in which the firſt Adam fell,</hi> and ſo did give a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blow to the body of ſin and death, by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that nature. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Chriſt took the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, and by death condemned ſin in the fleſh, that is, did <hi>give a blow</hi> to ſin in the fleſh, in the humane nature that hee took upon him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>That our old man is crucified with him:</hi> Chriſt took it up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs with him, and gave it a <hi>mortall wound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>faith</hi> doth <hi>diſcover</hi> this to the ſoule, when the ſoule findeth ſin ſtrugling and ſtriving
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93048:92"/>within, then ſaith <hi>Faith,</hi> this ſin ſtriving, is a part of that body of death that is in the Saints; now, O my ſoul, look up upon the Croſs, and ſee that body of death dying, therefore, O my ſoul, go out againſt it, and ſo <hi>faith</hi> encourageth the ſoul to go out againſt ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As <hi>Faith</hi> ſhews the ſoule ſin crucified with Chriſt, ſo it ſhews the ſoul, <hi>that the deſign of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> in giving a mortal blow to the old man, and body of death upon the Croſs, <hi>it was this, the weakning of the power of ſin, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of it in the Saints;</hi> that <hi>ſin</hi> might bee ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred, that it might not reign nor rule in the Saints, but bee continually in a declining lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition; therefore it is ſaid, Rom. 6.6. <hi>Our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might bee deſtroyed:</hi> hee doth not ſay, It is deſtroyed preſently; Chriſt took it up upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> gave it a <hi>mortal wound,</hi> that it might bee <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> in order to the deſtruction, that having the power broken, the Saints might the more eaſily get power over it. As an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that is already wounded (though a Gyant) is eaſily overcome; So though ſin bee ſtrong as a Gyant, Jeſus Chriſt hath wounded ſinne, therefore his ſtrength being taken away, is the more eaſily ſubdued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> ſhews the ſoul Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Faith,</hi> What, did Chriſt give ſin a <hi>mortal wound</hi> that it might bee <hi>deſtroyed?</hi> O then let not <hi>ſin</hi> live, O then <hi>ſin</hi> ſhall not live in mee!</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Faith</hi> ſhews the ſoule, <hi>that there is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſtreaming forth of vertue and efficacy from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the killing and ſubduing

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Faith</hi> is much in <hi>calling out the ſoul to the promiſes of mortification;</hi> we have a <hi>promiſe of mortification,</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you, for you are not under the Law but under grace.</hi> The ſoul that <hi>lives by faith,</hi> when it findeth <hi>ſin</hi> ſtrong, it taketh hold of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and goeth to Chriſt, and ſaith, Lord, thou haſt ſaid ſin ſhall not have dominion over me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, here is ſuch and ſuch a corruption too hard for me, Lord, behold, here is thy <hi>promiſe,</hi> look upon thy <hi>promiſe,</hi> remember thy <hi>promiſe,</hi> ſubdue my corruption; it firſt goeth to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and armeth it ſelf with ſtrength in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and then cometh and fighteth againſt <hi>ſin;</hi> and that is the matter wee are ſo often foyled with <hi>ſin,</hi> becauſe we try to combate with <hi>ſin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go to the <hi>promiſe.</hi> When a ſoul <hi>lives by faith</hi> for the ſubduing of <hi>ſin,</hi> there is firſt a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and then it encounters with <hi>ſin</hi> with ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Laſtly, <hi>Faith</hi> doth <hi>beget and maintaine in the ſoul a ſecret perſwaſion, though for the preſent it is compaſſed about with a weight of infirmities,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93048:93"/>yet God will ſupport it under all, and in Gods time it ſhall be a conquerour over all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I be for the <hi>preſent</hi> moleſted with <hi>ſin,</hi> yet a day will be, <hi>I ſhall</hi> be a Conquerour, and all theſe my enemies <hi>ſhall</hi> be under my feet; I <hi>ſhall</hi> ſet my feet upon the necks of all my <hi>ſins</hi> one day, and this carries the ſoul couragiouſſy out to fight againſt <hi>ſin</hi> for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How doth faith act in the buſineſs of</hi> vivification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Faith</hi> eyeth much the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt, and maketh the ſoul labour much after knowing Jeſus Chriſt in his Reſurrection,</hi> Phil. 3.10. <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and Fellowſhip of his Sufferings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made conformable to his death.</hi> Here are the two great things we are ſpeaking of, for hee is preſſing after perfection of Grace, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in theſe two, to <hi>have fellowſhip with Chriſt</hi> in his death, for <hi>mortification,</hi> and to <hi>know Chriſt in his Reſurrection,</hi> for <hi>vivification</hi> and <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>mortification</hi> comes by a <hi>dying</hi> Chriſt, ſo <hi>vivification</hi> cometh by a <hi>living</hi> Chriſt.</p>

That I may have the power of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> raiſing and <hi>quickning</hi> of mee. The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt, though but one act, yet hath a <hi>continual ſtream</hi> of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue flowing from it, for the <hi>quickning</hi> of ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Faith</hi> taketh hold of any <hi>word of promiſe in the book of God, that may bee any ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to beleeve his quickning it,</hi> as that word of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi>

                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why is a Chriſtian to live by faith for</hi> Sanctification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe our ſanctification is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of grace;</hi> therefore the Spirit by which wee are <hi>ſanctified,</hi> is ſaid to bee <hi>given of God;</hi> and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt (which hath ſuch an
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93048:94"/>influence into <hi>Sanctification</hi>) that is of <hi>Grace.</hi> It was of <hi>Grace</hi> that Chriſt ſhed his blood, of <hi>more grace</hi> that this blood of Chriſt ſhould bee applied to thy ſoul, for the waſhing away of thy ſin. So <hi>Faith</hi> which is a help in our <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> that is of <hi>Grace,</hi> therefore <hi>Faith</hi> is ſaid to bee the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>And to you it is given to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if <hi>Sanctification</hi> bee of <hi>Grace,</hi> wee are to <hi>live by faith</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe our Sanctification, as well as our Justification, is primarily in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is made Sanctification to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30 and ſo wee are to <hi>live by faith</hi> for it, for whatſoever is in the Lord Chriſt, I am to partake of it by <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe wee have promiſes of Sanctification;</hi> What I have a <hi>promiſe</hi> for, I am to <hi>live by faith</hi> for, becauſe the <hi>promiſe</hi> is the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> but wee have <hi>promiſes</hi> of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> of <hi>MORTIFICATION, Sin ſhall not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over yon,</hi> Rom. 6.14. of <hi>VIVIFICATION; becauſe I live, yee ſhall live alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.19. therefore wee are to <hi>live by faith</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Becauſe we are to pray for Sanctification, and therefore we are to beleeve for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is my duty to <hi>pray</hi> for, I am to <hi>beleeve</hi> for, becauſe <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt bee in <hi>faith.</hi> Every Petition I put up to God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is my duty (whether I do it or no) to <hi>act faith</hi> in the thing deſired. If I am to <hi>pray</hi> for it, I am to <hi>beleeve</hi> for it. But I am to <hi>pray</hi> for it. Jeſus Chriſt teacheth us to <hi>pray</hi> for it, when hee himſelf prayed for our <hi>Sanctification.</hi>

                     <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt teaches it, in that <hi>Prayer</hi> we call the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the three firſt Petitions reſpecting in a great part our <hi>Sanctification, Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> It is as much as that God would help us to honour and <hi>Sanctifie</hi> his great Name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy Kingdome come;</hi> It is as much as to <hi>pray</hi> that God would ſet up his <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi> in our hearts, that we might bee ruled and guided by his Spirit, having all corruption <hi>mortified,</hi> and grace <hi>quickned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,</hi> This is as much as to <hi>pray,</hi> that wee poor creatures here on earth, might <hi>do the will of God</hi> ſo freely, fully, and cheerfully, as the Saints in Heaven; So that wee are to <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and then wee are to <hi>beleeve</hi> for it, becauſe our <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt bee in <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>What is the difference between that</hi> Sanctification <hi>which ariſeth from an</hi> enlightned conſcience, <hi>and that</hi> Sanctification <hi>which ariſeth from</hi> faith or beleeving?</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Sanctification</hi> which ariſeth from the meer dictates of the Law of Nature, and that <hi>Sanctification</hi> the Heathen Moraliſts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a great deal of: And there is a Jewiſh <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or Legal, and that is ſuch a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> as is begotten by the terrors of the Law. But there is another <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and that is a <hi>Goſpel-Sanctification,</hi> that is ſuch a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> as is wrought in the ſoul from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch a <hi>Sanctification</hi> as is wrought from <hi>beleeving</hi> his <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:93048:95"/>
                  <p>Now there is a <hi>great difference</hi> between this <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and the other, which ariſes onely from an <hi>enlightned conſcience,</hi> for both ariſe from an <hi>enlightned conſcience,</hi> the one from <hi>conſcience</hi> being enlightned by Natures law, the other from the written Law, but there is a <hi>great difference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>That which ariſeth from natural conſcience is ſomething of the more groſs part of Sanctification, but a piece, and doth not take in any thing of the finer part of Sanctification.</hi> A for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſome ſins that are outward and groſs, his <hi>conſcience</hi> cannot but flye in his face, ſo that hee ſhall not reſt quietly night nor day, ſuch as Drunkenneſs, Adultery, and the like.</p>
                  <p>It is in reſpect of thoſe duties that are more apparent, ſuch as Prayer, hearing the word, ſuch, if a man ſhould let alone, hee ſhould have no quiet, nor peace in <hi>conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that <hi>Sanctification that cometh from faith, that is in reſpect of the inward, more ſecret evils of the ſoul;</hi> the <hi>ſecret</hi> riſing of pride, unbeleef, and paſſion, and ſo for more <hi>inward duties,</hi> that <hi>Sanctification</hi> teacheth a man to deny himſelf, to ſubmit himſelf to Gods will, to be content with Gods diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That Sanctification which cometh from an inlightned conſcience onely, raiſeth a man to bee more ſelf conceited; but that Sanctification that cometh from faith and beleeving, throweth a man down in reſpect of all ſelf-conceit, it maketh a man more mean and low in his own eyes:</hi> As the Scribes and Phariſees, and <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time, they had a great deal of this <hi>outward</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and <hi>Sanctification;</hi> but ſee how it <hi>puffed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93048:96"/>them up,</hi> how they ſtand upon tip-toes, and crow over poor Harlots and Publicans, as not fit to come in the company of ſuch as they were.</p>
                  <p>But that which <hi>cometh from faith, maketh the ſoul more humble.</hi> What abundance of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication Paul</hi> had, hee did preſs after <hi>perfection,</hi> did walk more like one in heaven, than on earth, yet hee could look upon himſelf as the <hi>leaſt of Saints,</hi> concerning acting for God, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the work of God, hee preached the Goſpel from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illiricum</hi> laboured more abundantly than they all, yet how <hi>humble; Yet not I, but the grace of God in me;</hi> and ſo hee ſaith, in nothing hee came behinde the chiefeſt Apoſtles, yet ſaith, <hi>I am nothing.</hi> So concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uprightneſs of converſation, hee walked before God in all <hi>good conſcience,</hi> knew nothing by himſelf, yet how <hi>humble,</hi> yet <hi>hereby am I not juſtified, and not that I can do any thing of my ſelf;</hi> yea, hee ſaith, hee was the chiefeſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, hee ſeeth it is not wrought by his own proper induſtry, but by the <hi>grace</hi> of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he giveth him all the glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>That Sanctification which is wrought by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, is grievous and irkſome, becauſe it is againſt the will, it is a forced holineſs, hee is conſtrained to it.</hi> It is his will to ſin, but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> will not ſuffer him; his will is to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in the ſervice of God, if hee might go to heaven but his <hi>conſcience</hi> puts him in hell if hee doth nothing, and ſo it is grievous to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But that Sanctification which is though faith,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93048:96"/>that is pleaſant to the ſoul.</hi> That that is <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> is <hi>pleaſant.</hi> God puts the <hi>New nature</hi> within, and then it is in ſome meaſure <hi>natural</hi> to bee holy, to avoid ſin, to do the will of God: Therefore ſee how <hi>differenly</hi> wicked men and godly men <hi>ſpeak of the wayes</hi> of God, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. Sec the language of wicked men, they ſay to God, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy wayes:</hi> Here is the language of wicked men, they cannot help it for their lives, but they ſhall have ſome knowledge of the wayes of God, the Law of Nature teacheth ſomething of Gods wayes, and they have his word, and that tells ſomething more. O ſay they, <hi>Depart, we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes,</hi> we are troubled at the knowledge of ſuch things, it torments us, this is the language of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Then again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. v. 33. we read of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men that heard the word of God, but it was ſo tedious, that they call it a <hi>Burden,</hi> they come to the Prophet, and ask, <hi>What it the burden of the Lord?</hi> It was grown into a Proverb, the wayes of God were ſo tedious and irkſome.</p>
                  <p>But now do but ſee how Godly men <hi>ſpeak of the wayes</hi> of God. See what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 19.7, 8, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the ſoul, the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure making wiſe the ſimple, the Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart,</hi> verſ. 9, 10. <hi>The judgements of the Lord are righteous altogether, more to be deſired than gold, than much fine gold, ſweeter than the honey and honey comb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:93048:97"/>
                  <p>They do not cry, <hi>Depart,</hi> we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes, they do not call them a <hi>burden.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. verſ. 72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is better to mee than thouſands of gold and ſilver,</hi> verſ. 130. <hi>How ſweet are thy words to my taſte, ſweeter than honey.</hi> See how <hi>David ſpeaketh</hi> of the will of God; the wiſe man telleth us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.19. It is an abomination to fools to <hi>depart</hi> from evill; It is an abomination to <hi>depart</hi> from ſin, it is that hee hates. The fool, that is the wicked man: It may bee hee doth <hi>depart</hi> from ſome ſins, his <hi>conſcience</hi> makes him <hi>depart</hi> from ſome ſin, fear of Hell, the terrors of the Law, but it is an abomination; hee may <hi>depart</hi> from it, but hee hates it with his very life, not ſin, but the <hi>departing</hi> from ſin; that hee muſt <hi>part</hi> with his drunkenneſs, the Drunkard would fain have his cups, and the Adulterer his Quean, but his <hi>conſcience</hi> ſo terrifieth him that he dares not have them, but <hi>departs</hi> from them, but hee hateth the <hi>departing</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>But ſee a godly man, it is his delight to <hi>part</hi> from them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. verſ. 143. <hi>Trouble and anguiſh have taken hold upon me, but thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are my delight,</hi> verſ. 47. <hi>I delight my ſelf in thy Commandements which I have loved.</hi> A hundred and twenty times in this Pſalm, the Pſalmiſt uſeth ſuch phraſes as expreſs his <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> unto the wayes of God, <hi>I delight in thy Law, I love thy teſtimonies.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If at any time the ſoul is leaſt in duties of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> it is when the <hi>conſcience</hi> is moſt unquiet.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Laſtly, <hi>That Sanctification that ariſeth from natural conſcience, makes a man an enemy to all theſe that are truly and ſpiritually ſanctified.

                  </p>
                  <p>I have told you, that the phraſe of <hi>living by faith,</hi> is taken in Scripture in reſpect of <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Sanctification, Expectation,</hi> and <hi>Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> we have ſpoken of the two former, now of the third, the <hi>life of Faith</hi> relating to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>Expectation,</hi> a Chriſtian is to <hi>live</hi> upon God in way of <hi>expectation,</hi> to wait upon God, he is to <hi>expect</hi> much in way of <hi>faith.</hi> That wee are to <hi>live by faith</hi> in this reſpect, is clear from that teſtimony of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the third verſ. <hi>For the viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak</hi> — at the fourth verſ. <hi>But the juſt ſhall live by his faith;</hi> by <hi>his faith,</hi> the time whilſt the Viſion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed he lives <hi>by his faith,</hi> expecting much, while much is delayed, expecting the fulfilling of the Promiſes, while it is delayed; all the time that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93048:98"/>much is delayed, all that time of a Chriſtian he is to <hi>live by faith;</hi> the Scripture tells us, that Abraham <hi>beleeved God,</hi> he had a promiſe, and it was delayed year after year, hee looks for the promiſe, and for the performance thereof, and yet delayed; <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for the mercy in way of <hi>faith,</hi> and the fulfilling of the promiſe was made to him, but hee muſt firſt wait for it.</p>
                  <p>In the handling of theſe things wee ſhall ſhew you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What thoſe things are that a Chriſtian waits for, what thoſe things are that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian expects by faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 How Faith acts the ſoul in this buſineſs of expectation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Why we muſt live by faith in this reſpect,</p>
                  <p n="4">4 What manner of waiting that is, that comes in beleeving.</p>
                  <p>And ſo apply it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe things that a Chriſtian waits for, and expects, are many;</hi> but a Chriſtian doth by ſaith wait for ſomething <hi>more eſpecially,</hi> that he doth expect and wait for in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The fulfilling of Promiſes;</hi> if the Lord hath made a promiſe to the ſoul, or it the ſoul hath been made to wait upon a word of promiſe, now he <hi>waits</hi> upon God beleevingly to ſee the accompliſhment of this <hi>promiſe. David</hi> had a word of <hi>promiſe</hi> from the Lord, and <hi>waits</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord for the accompliſhment of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. ver. <hi>Remember the word unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope;</hi> hee
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93048:99"/>had a word, and grounds his hope upon it, <hi>waits</hi> upon God for the fulfilling of it. So we read of <hi>Simeon,</hi> that <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> man ſpoken of in the ſecond of <hi>Luke,</hi> verſ. 26. he had a word that he ſhould not dye until he ſaw Jeſus Chriſt in the Fleſh, and he <hi>waited</hi> for the conſolation of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> he had a word and <hi>waited</hi> for it, at the 25. and 26. verſes; — A word was given in to him, and it was revealed to him by the Spirit, that <hi>he ſhould ſee Chriſt,</hi> and hee <hi>waited</hi> for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it; ſo a poor ſoul when it hath <hi>any promiſe</hi> given in by the Lord, or is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to take hold on <hi>any promiſe,</hi> and meets with a <hi>promiſe</hi> ſutable to its condition, a ſoul that <hi>lives by faith waits</hi> upon God for the <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of this <hi>promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="6">6 Again, one more, The ſoul waits <hi>for the Lords ſecond coming;</hi> thats a thing the ſoul may <hi>wait</hi> for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> Now look in the former words, and hee ſhall live by faith in the expectation of Chriſts ſecond coming, verſ. 37. <hi>Hee that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry.</hi> So in Chap. 9. verſ. 28. <hi>To them that look for him, he ſhall appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation.</hi> What, a looking, waiting, and expectation for Chriſts ſecond coming in the Spirit? <hi>Rev.</hi> the laſt Chap. v. 17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſaith come;</hi> here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waiting, longing, the Spirit cries come, and the Bride cryes come, the Spirit in the hearts of the people of God, cryes come, waiting for Chriſts coming; yea, this is made a character of a Chriſtian, and a great work of the Goſpel, to wait for Chriſts coming, 1 Theſſ. 1.9, 10. <hi>They themſelves ſhew of us, what manner of entring in we had unto you, And to wait for his Son from

Thus what it is that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>wait,</hi> and <hi>expect</hi> for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How the life of faith <hi>acts,</hi> or how faith is <hi>helpful to a ſoul in this buſineſs of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Expectation and waiting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith,</hi> or the life of faith, <hi>it ever ſeeks out ſome promiſe, upon which it may ground an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that mercy that it waits for.</hi> I ſay, the life of faith, it ever looks out ſome <hi>Promiſe,</hi> upon which it may ground an expectation of that mercy it waits for. Faith it muſt have its <hi>word,</hi> and therefore the ſoul that doth by faith <hi>expect</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> for any mercy, it ever looks out for a <hi>word</hi> and <hi>promiſe,</hi> goes ever to the <hi>word</hi> to ſee what <hi>ground</hi> it hath to ſtand upon, and to <hi>wait</hi> for ſuch a mercy; the <hi>life of faith</hi> does turn over the Bible, and looks out the <hi>promiſe,</hi> findes out the <hi>promiſe</hi> of that mercy, never reſts till it have a <hi>promiſe,</hi> and then it pitches its ſtandard upon the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and there it ſtands, and looks up to heaven, <hi>waiting</hi> for the accompliſhment of that <hi>promiſe.</hi> When <hi>Daniel</hi> did <hi>expect</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh Captivity, he did <hi>ground</hi> it upon a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> had foretold it ſhould continue ſeventy years, now <hi>Daniel</hi> goes to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and when they were expired, prayes unto God for the deliverance, and upon this <hi>word of promiſe</hi> ſeeks God, and beleeves it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and <hi>expects</hi> it from the <hi>promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As <hi>Faith</hi> doth cauſe a ſoul to ſeek
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93048:101"/>out a promiſe, ſo having found the <hi>promiſe,</hi> does not <hi>limit God to any time or way for the fulfilling of this promiſe.</hi> Another ſoul that doth not <hi>live by faith,</hi> if ſo bee that hee doth <hi>wait</hi> upon God at all, yet hee will <hi>limit</hi> God, and <hi>tye</hi> up God to his <hi>own time and way; Iſrael limited the holy One,</hi> Pſal. 78.41. and hee that <hi>expects</hi> much in the <hi>way of faith,</hi> that ſoul will not <hi>limit</hi> God to <hi>his time and way;</hi> if I have it not to day, I can <hi>wait</hi> no longer; no, that ſoul will <hi>wait</hi> upon God, <hi>Gods time,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſayes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15. <hi>My times are in thy hand:</hi> So ſayes a ſoul, <hi>Times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of mercy are in thy hands, if I ſhould have it now to day, I ſhould bee glad, and rejoyce, and bleſs the Lord for it; if thou doſt withhold it, <hi>My times are in thy hands,</hi> yet I deſire to <hi>wait;</hi> no reaſon that I ſhould ſpeak againſt the Lord, and entertain hard thoughts of God, if thou withhold the mercy, yet I will <hi>wait</hi> for it, Take thy own time, O Lord. Then it doth not limit God to <hi>any way of performance:</hi> A ſoul that <hi>expects</hi> mercy in <hi>way</hi> of faith, it doth not <hi>limit</hi> God to <hi>any way,</hi> ſo far as concerns <hi>Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it is not the <hi>way</hi> of faith to <hi>limit God</hi> to any <hi>way;</hi> An ungodly man will many times <hi>tye</hi> God to <hi>wayes;</hi> But a ſoul that doth by <hi>faith expect</hi> a mercy, that ſoul leaves God to his <hi>own way.</hi> We read of <hi>Moſes</hi> once or twice, tying God up to his own way: When the people were in great ſtreights, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14, at the red Sea, 14, 15. verſ. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſight for you, and yet ſhall hold your peace; And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Wherefore cryeſt thou unto mee? Speak unto the children of Iſrael, that they go forward;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93048:102"/>Moſes</hi> at the 13. verſe goes and layes out a <hi>way,</hi> and that was to <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> and God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their enemies: and that was not <hi>Gods way,</hi> hee goes to God, and cryes unto him, that hee would come with ſome immediate hand, and deſtroy them from heaven; this was <hi>Moſes way,</hi> and now <hi>Gods way</hi> was, that they ſhould <hi>go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and paſs through the Sea, at the 16, verſ. <hi>But lift up thy rod, and ſtretch out thine hand over the Sea, and divide it, and the Children of Iſrael ſhall go on dry ground through the midſt of the Sea.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> bid them to <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> but God bids them to <hi>go for ward,</hi> and ſo they did, did not <hi>ty up God to his own way:</hi> And ſo at another time wee finde <hi>Moſes limiting</hi> of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. for want of fleſh, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured; well ſayes the Lord, <hi>Therefore the Lord will give you fleſh, and yee ſhall eat, yee ſhall not eat one day, nor two dayes, nor five dayes, neither ten dayes, nor twenty dayes, but even a whole month,</hi> 18, 19, 20 verſ. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid at the 21. verſ. <hi>The people amongſt whom I am, are ſix hundred thouſand footmen, and thou haſt ſaid, I will give them fleſh, that they may eat an whole month, ſhall the flicks and herds be ſlain for them, to ſuffice them? or ſhall all the fiſh of the ſea be gathered together for them, to ſuffice them? Moſes</hi> thought of no <hi>way,</hi> unleſs their flocks were killed, or the fiſh of the ſea to bee gathered together, and <hi>Moſes</hi> thought this <hi>the way,</hi> and ſo preſcribes <hi>God a way:</hi> So a ſoul ſo far as it is <hi>waiting</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and <hi>not in faith,</hi> it will preſcribe God <hi>a way;</hi> but a ſoul that doth <hi>expect in faith</hi> for a mercy, it will not bee preſcribing God <hi>a way.</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:93048:102"/>So <hi>Abraham</hi> hee leaves God to his <hi>own way.</hi> God bids him offer up his Son, hee doth not ſay, Why my Son, why, how will thy promiſe bee accompliſhed, and made good; art not thou faithfull? <hi>Abraham</hi> leaves God to <hi>his own way,</hi> and beleeved that God could finde <hi>a way</hi> for the fulfilling of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and did not <hi>limit</hi> God to <hi>any way;</hi> a ſoul that <hi>lives by faith</hi> waits upon God for the fulfilling of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and doth not <hi>limit</hi> the Lord to <hi>any time,</hi> or <hi>way</hi> of his own.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>life of faith</hi> in our <hi>Expectation,</hi> as it doth cauſe the ſoul to look out to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and having the <hi>promiſe,</hi> doth not <hi>tye or limit</hi> the Lord to his <hi>own time or way,</hi> for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it; ſo it doth <hi>perſwade the ſoul, though it know not the time when, yet a time there is, wherein the promiſe ſhall be fulfilled, and that mercy I wait for ſhal be given in.</hi> It doth perſwade the ſoul that there is a <hi>time</hi> it ſhall bee given in, the Lord hath his <hi>ſet time,</hi> in which hee doth fulfill his <hi>promiſe,</hi> and in which hee doth give in his <hi>mercy</hi> to his people, a <hi>ſet time</hi> for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that <hi>promiſe</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his ſeed ſhould inherit <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 15.16. When the iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> ſhould bee full, in the fourth Generation. So God had a <hi>ſet time</hi> when hee would deliver the people out of the houſe of bondage, the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> at the <hi>ſet time</hi> it was, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. And it came to paſs at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the ſelf-ſame day, it came to paſs, that all the hoaſts of the Lord, went out from the land
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93048:103"/>of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo God had a <hi>ſet time</hi> wherein hee ſent his Son Jeſus Chriſt into the world, <hi>that time</hi> is called, <hi>The fulneſs of time,</hi> Gal. 4.4. <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law:</hi> A <hi>ſet time</hi> for that; And ſo likewiſe there was a <hi>ſet time,</hi> when Chriſt ſuffered: God hath a <hi>ſet time,</hi> even for an hour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Now before the feaſt of the Paſſeover, when Jeſus knew that his hour was come, that hee ſhould depart out of this world, unto the Father;</hi> a <hi>ſet time,</hi> even to an hour that God appointed Chriſt to dye, and therefore hee ſaid, that they could not lay hands on him, becauſe his hour was not come; and ſo a <hi>ſet time</hi> to build up Sion, and to build up the Church, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 102.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Sion, for the time to favour her, yea the ſet time is come:</hi> So God hath a <hi>ſet time</hi> to perform what ever he hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to his people. Now ſayes a ſoul that <hi>lives by faith,</hi> when that <hi>ſet time</hi> is come, I ſhall have the mercy, and though the <hi>promiſe</hi> bee delayed to day, to morrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades it ſelf, that when the <hi>ſet time</hi> is come, it ſhall have the mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The life of faith, it cauſeth the ſoule quietly to wait upon God without murmuring, till the time, the ſet time doth come:</hi> It makes the ſoul quiet and patient till the <hi>ſet time</hi> doth come; <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>All the time of my appointed time, I will wait, until my change come,</hi> an <hi>appointed time,</hi> there was an <hi>appointed time,</hi> and hee <hi>waits</hi> upon God till the <hi>time</hi> come; So of the Church in the Canticles, its very clear for this; in Chap. 3. verſ. 5. <hi>I charge you, O yee daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93048:103"/>of Jeruſalem, by the Roes, and by the Hindes of the field, that yee ſtir not up, nor awake my love untill hee pleaſe;</hi> There is a <hi>time</hi> wherein it pleaſeth Chriſt to come, a <hi>ſet time,</hi> before which hee will not come, <hi>Stir not up my love untill hee pleaſe,</hi> till the <hi>time</hi> is when hee will come, no ſtirring up by impatience, and the like, till hee pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>So much for the ſecond thing, How faith doth put forth it ſelf, or helps the ſoul to wait upon God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Why a ſoul is to expect mercy in the way of faith,</hi> or is to live beleeving in his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p n="1">1 One reaſon is, becauſe <hi>our expectation of mercy, it muſt alwayes be grounded upon a promiſe, or otherwiſe our expectation is nothing:</hi> In vain do wee <hi>expect,</hi> that which God hath not <hi>promiſed</hi> to give, if it muſt bee <hi>grounded</hi> upon a <hi>promiſe</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, then I muſt <hi>live by faith,</hi> even in my <hi>Expectation,</hi> becauſe without <hi>faith,</hi> there is no taking hold of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> neither can hee cloſe with the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and in his <hi>expectation,</hi> hee muſt take hold on the <hi>promiſe,</hi> or elſe it is in vain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hee muſt <hi>live by faith</hi> in his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> or elſe <hi>hee will never bee able to hold out long in his expectation:</hi> Where there is not an <hi>acting of faith,</hi> there the ſoul dyes, that ſoule that doth not <hi>wait</hi> upon God in a <hi>way of faith,</hi> that ſoul dyes, and cannot hold out long, and ſo t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>res, and cannot <hi>wait</hi> long; <hi>waiting</hi> is a long and hard work, <hi>faith</hi> is our ſtrength, and if we have no faith, wee ſhall never bee able to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93048:104"/>go through this hard work; a Horſe that wants mettle, will never bee able to hold out; put him to hard ſervice, hee will not hold out; <hi>Faith</hi> is the mettle of the ſoul, if wee have no <hi>faith,</hi> wee cannot hold out in our <hi>waiting</hi> upon God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Again, we muſt <hi>live by faith</hi> in our <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> becauſe <hi>otherwiſe though the mercy ſhould come in which we wait for, yet if it do come in, and not in a way of faith, it will not bee ſo ſweet and comfortable to a ſoul.</hi> If it doth not come in, in a way of faith, its otherwiſe: Mercies beleeved for, are the ſweeteſt; Mercies that I have waited for in a way of faith, are the ſweeteſt mercies, which I have beleeved for.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>What waiting is that, which comes from faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ</hi> 1. That waiting is a <hi>patient waiting,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to murmuring and repining, <hi>I waited pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the Lord,</hi> Pſal 40.1. and Pſal. 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord and wait patiently for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is an <hi>humble waiting,</hi> hee is made <hi>humble</hi> by his <hi>waiting;</hi> it is onely an <hi>humble</hi> ſoul that will <hi>wait</hi> upon the Lord, that beleevingly will <hi>wait</hi> for God, therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. the poor of the flock waited upon God, at the 11. verſ. <hi>The poor of the flock that waited upon me;</hi> It muſt bee poor ſouls that will <hi>wait</hi> upon God, a ſoul that is rich, and proud, and conceited that he hath ſomething, will not <hi>wait</hi> upon God; indeed it is an <hi>humble waiting,</hi> that a ſoule <hi>waits</hi> upon God in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Again, It is a <hi>diligent and induſtrious wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi> not a careleſs <hi>waiting,</hi> but a <hi>diligent waiting</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:93048:104"/>in his own way, and means, and Ordinances that God walks in, and works in, where a ſoul will <hi>wait diligently</hi> upon God at the poſt of his doors, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors,</hi> Prov. 8.34.</p>

There is a <hi>promiſe</hi> that the Lords ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs; Labour to work this <hi>promiſe</hi> home upon thy heart: And haſt thou loſt ſtrength in departing from God, and art weakned and is ſtrength gone? There is a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of renewing ſtrength, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31. <hi>But they that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not bee weary, they ſhall walk, and not faint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now labour to work this upon thy heart, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength,</hi> and ſo go out in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> upon God; and ſo what ever mercy it is, there's no mercy that thou canſt wait for, and expect, but there's a <hi>promiſe</hi> for it in the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Do not adviſe too much with your own reaſon;</hi> If you would <hi>wait</hi> upon God, do not adviſe too much with your own reaſon: Reaſon will beat you off from <hi>waiting</hi> upon God; What you, <hi>waiting</hi> upon God, and haſt ſo many ſins, and will God regard ſuch as you! So long you have <hi>waited,</hi> and no mercy come; and doſt thou ever think to have any thing? Thus <hi>Carnal reaſon</hi> will beat us off from <hi>waiting,</hi>

Go and beg this Spirit of God, that is the <hi>great Goſpel-promiſe:</hi> Now hath God <hi>promiſed</hi> the Spirit, and cannot you <hi>wait</hi> upon God, and live by faith without the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>Go home, and ſay, Lord, Lord I Give mee thy Spirit, and ſpirituallize this thy poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Have I been a ſtranger to the Spirit, no wonder then that I cannot wait upon God no more, therefore would you <hi>wait</hi> upon God in faith, <hi>Beg his Spirit.</hi>

               <p>There is a twofold <hi>ſobriety:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a <hi>ſobriety</hi> oppoſite to <hi>intemperance in outward things,</hi> in meats, drinks, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93048:115"/>content my ſelf with <hi>Gods time:</hi> Now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Be ſober,</hi> do not tye up God to <hi>your time;</hi> Now this <hi>ſobriety,</hi> what is it but <hi>patience?</hi> It is <hi>patience</hi> joyned with <hi>hope,</hi> Heb. 10.36. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the promiſe, is the thing hope looks at, <hi>Now,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>yee have need of patience, that after yee have done the will of Ged, yee might receive the promiſe. Hope</hi> looks to <hi>receiving</hi> the promiſe; all the time of a Chriſtians life is a time wherein hee is, or ſhould bee doing the will of God, the <hi>end</hi> is the <hi>time of receiving</hi> the promiſes.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe a Chriſtians deſire is much carried out to <hi>receiving</hi> the promiſe, and that is a great way off as wee look upon them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>You have need of patience,</hi> that ſo your eager deſires of <hi>receiving</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe do not ſo over-ſet you, that you cannot go on cheerfully doing the will of God that time God will have you: So it is many times, the deſires of a Chriſtian after heaven, and eternal life, they are ſo carried out, O when ſhall I receive the promiſe, come to reſt in the boſome of the Father? That a Chriſtian finds it a difficult thing to keep his heart in order, ſo as to go quietly on, doing the will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and that, and to ſtay, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to do that work God would have him do between this and heaven, therefore you have need of <hi>patience,</hi> that ſo when hope is in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> of the promiſe, our hope may not ſo vehemently carry us out after <hi>receiving</hi> the promiſe, that you may not bee diſcontented at the time our Father will have us be here. So
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93048:115"/>that is one thing in <hi>Chriſtian hope,</hi> it is a <hi>patient Expectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an <hi>aſſured Expectation;</hi> ſuch an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> as hath ſome meaſure of <hi>aſſurance</hi> going with it, not a bare conjecture, but ſuch as ariſeth from <hi>faith,</hi> a divine <hi>faith,</hi> therefore there is <hi>confidence</hi> going along with a <hi>Chriſtian hope;</hi> look how much <hi>faith apprehends</hi> the promiſe, ſo much doth <hi>hope expect</hi> the fulfilling of it. Therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for: Faith</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the <hi>promiſe,</hi> it holds in his hand the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of all thoſe good things wee <hi>expect</hi> hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe <hi>faith</hi> hath not actuall poſſeſſion of them, therefore they are <hi>hoped</hi> for, <hi>hope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects</hi> them, but <hi>faith</hi> is the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> therefore this <hi>hope is grounded</hi> upon faith, though it hath them not, it doth in a manner injoy them by imbracing the <hi>promiſe;</hi> therefore <hi>hope</hi> ſpringing from <hi>faith</hi> muſt bee ſuch a <hi>hope</hi> as our <hi>faith</hi> is, <hi>faith</hi> is not a bare groundleſs <hi>conjecture,</hi> but a <hi>certainty;</hi> ſo muſt our <hi>hope,</hi> Heb. 5.6. it is called the <hi>rejoycing of hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>rejoycing</hi> doth not ariſe from a bare <hi>fancie,</hi> and conjecture, but from ſome meaſure of <hi>certainty;</hi> for a man to <hi>fancie</hi> he ſhall in joy a Kingdome, this doth not beget <hi>rejoycing,</hi> ſo it hath <hi>aſſurance</hi> joyned with it, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>We deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to the full aſſurance of hope to the end;</hi> which argues, it is not a <hi>bare probability,</hi> but there is ſomething of <hi>certainty</hi> in <hi>Chriſtian hope,</hi> yet this <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>hope,</hi> is according to the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93048:116"/>
                  <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> if the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> bee grounded upon a general promiſe, and cannot be brought to a particular promiſe, ſuch is the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>hope;</hi> but if <hi>faith</hi> bee grounded upon a particular promiſe, ſuch is the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the next thing, to ſhew <hi>how hope is reſembled to an Anchor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Hope layes hold out of ſight;</hi> caſt an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> it faſtens at the bottome of the Sea out of our ſight; ſo doth hope, it faſtens <hi>within the vail,</hi> there is the place where a Chriſtians hope pitcheth, beyond ſight, <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, an Anchor though it faſtens out of ſight, yet <hi>it faſtens on the rock;</hi> caſt an <hi>Anchor,</hi> if there be <hi>a rock,</hi> it faſtens upon the <hi>rock;</hi> ſo a <hi>Chriſtians hope faſtens</hi> upon the <hi>Rock</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, a Chriſtians hope is faſtned upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, an Anchor by faſtening upon the rock fixes the ſhip, ſo that though the waves ſwell and beat, yet the ſhip is fixed, ſo it is with a Chriſtians hope faſtening upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it <hi>faſtens the ſoul:</hi> Let temptations and corruptions ſwell, if a poor ſoul have hope in Chriſt as his Chriſt, that ſoul is <hi>fixed</hi> immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that hope it hath of injoying Chriſt, the promiſe of heaven one day, this hope it is that <hi>fixes the ſoul,</hi> that it is not turned this way and that, not driven this way, and that, as another that hath no hope; Let a tempeſt ariſe within or without, yet if it have an <hi>Anchor of hope,</hi> caſt within the vail, that it comes but to have
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93048:116"/>ſome hope, can ſay, Jeſus Chriſt is mine, it is <hi>fixed immoveable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, An Anchor by faſtening upon the rock, fixing the ſhip, the ſhip <hi>is preſerved from ſhipwrack;</hi> ſo is the ſoul: Another poor ſoul that hath no <hi>Chriſtian hope,</hi> the ſtorm ariſes, there is but a little bluſtering, and its <hi>ſplit</hi> upon the rock, if he ride it out one ſtorm, another will come and <hi>ſplit</hi> him; but that ſoul that hath caſt Anchor upon Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall bee <hi>for ever preſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay, Wherein is the Excellency of this Anchor of hope above others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> One wee have in the Text, <hi>All other Anchors they are caſt downward, this is caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for it enters in to that within the vail,</hi> it goes upward, it is caſt within the vaile: There is the place where this Anchor of hope is caſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Conſider the <hi>properties (which are in the Text) of this Anchor;</hi> It is a <hi>ſure,</hi> and a <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> Anchor.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ſure,</hi> that is a <hi>ſafe Anchor,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of hope when it reſts upon this rock, it never deceives, <hi>Hope makes not aſhamed.</hi> And then it is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſtedfaſt Anchor,</hi> It holds the ſoul ſteady, unmoveable, and both theſe in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of <hi>the ſtrength of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> it is <hi>a ſtrong Anchor;</hi> another may bee broken, and many times is, but the <hi>Anchor of hope,</hi> is ſuch an <hi>Anchor</hi> as can never bee broken; a Chriſtians <hi>hope</hi> is maintained by his <hi>faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:93048:117"/>and his <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> by Chriſt, though actings of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> may ceaſe for a while, yet his <hi>hope</hi> can never bee broken, there is <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> ſtill at the bottome, in a Chriſtian.</p>

               <p>The third thing is the thing I ſhall ſpeak to at this time, that is, <hi>The place were this Anchor is caſt,</hi> and that is, <hi>within the vail;</hi> the Anchor-ground of a Saint is <hi>within the vail: Which hope we have as an Anchor of the ſoul, ſure and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and which entreth into that within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the opening of it I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1 What is the meaning of this phraſe of ſpeech, <hi>Within the vail.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>What is the meaning of this phraſe, within the vail?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words are ſpoken by an alluſion to the Temple and Tabernacle of old: The Temple of old had three parts in it; there was the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93048:117"/>Court,</hi> and the <hi>Holy place,</hi> and the <hi>Holy of Holies:</hi> The outward Court, into that came all ſorts of perſons, that is, all ſorts of the <hi>Jews</hi> came into the <hi>outward Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Into the <hi>Holy place</hi> came thoſe that did the ſervice about holy things, the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites; into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> entered onely the High Prieſt once a year with blood, Theſe were typical.</p>
               <p>The <hi>outward Court</hi> typified <hi>common Profeſſors</hi> of all ſorts, the <hi>holy place</hi> wherin entred thoſe that performed the ſervice and worſhip of God, typified the <hi>Church,</hi> Viſible Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> typified <hi>Heaven.</hi> Now between the <hi>Holy place,</hi> and the <hi>moſt Holy,</hi> was a <hi>vail,</hi> a precious hanging of blue Purple, and Scarlet, as you may ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.31, 32. <hi>And the vail ſhall divide unto you between the Holy place, and the moſt Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here was the uſe of the <hi>vail,</hi> it was to divide between the Holy place, and the moſt Holy. Now <hi>within the vail,</hi> was the moſt Holy place, or Holy of Holies: Now the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> that was a type of <hi>Heaven:</hi> And as you may ſee, if you look into <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Chriſt is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Holy place</hi> made with hands, into which the High Prieſt entred once a year, typified <hi>Heaven,</hi> the figure of the true, which is <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf, whither Chriſt is gone. Now this <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> that was the place that was <hi>within
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93048:118"/>the vail;</hi> for the <hi>holy place,</hi> and <hi>outward Court</hi> was without the <hi>vail:</hi> Now wee ſhall fee the meaning of <hi>within the vail;</hi> that is, <hi>A Chriſtians hope is grounded upon ſomething out of this world, ſomething in Heaven;</hi> For <hi>within the vail,</hi> was the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> ſo that a Chriſtians hope is grounded upon ſomething that is not in all this world, ſomething in Heaven, within the vaile; that is, a Chriſtian caſts his <hi>Anchor</hi> of hope as far as Heaven, and fixes, and layes hold upon ſomething in Heaven, <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But you will ſay, What is that within the vaile, that a Chriſtians hope can found upon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> O there is <hi>abundance within the vail,</hi> for a Chriſtian to ground his hope upon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Within the vail</hi> there is the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Rock of Ages:</hi> As it is in the verſe following the Text, <hi>Whither the forerunner is for us entred, even Jeſus;</hi> ſo wee have <hi>Jeſus Chriſt within the vail,</hi> who is that onely Rock, upon which all our ſouls muſt anchor, that Rock is <hi>within the vail,</hi> is now in Heaven. But then conſider, <hi>Chriſt is within the vail,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, as a <hi>Forerunner, Whither the Forerunner is for us entred;</hi> that is, Chriſt is now entred into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as our <hi>Forerunner,</hi> as one that is gone before, to make way for us into Heaven, one that is gone before to draw us into heaven after him: And is not here <hi>great ground</hi> for a Chriſtians hope to found upon, that the Lord Chriſt the only Rock is in heaven, and gone as a Forerunner to make way, to ſet open heaven gates for us; and as one that will draw in all his Children after him? What <hi>ground</hi> is here for hope, that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93048:118"/>the Lord Jeſus is in Heaven, as my Forerunner, and therefore hath made way for mee, and therefore will draw mee after him: When hope pitches upon this, and eyes this Jeſus as a Forerunner, that is entred into Heaven, this ſtrengthens the hope of a Saint.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Jeſus, as hee is entred within the vail as a <hi>Forerunner,</hi> ſo as the <hi>Great Sacrifice:</hi> The High Prieſt in the time of the Law when the <hi>Great Sacrifice,</hi> the Annual Sacrifice, the yearly Sacrifice, the High Prieſt, as ſoon as the <hi>Great Sacrifice</hi> was ſlain without, was to take the bloud of that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and carry it <hi>within the vail;</hi> Thus the body of Jeſus, when ſlain, was the <hi>Great Sacrifice,</hi> and Chriſt takes his own blood, and carries it into the <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Great Sacrifice</hi> is carried <hi>within the vail,</hi> Heb. 9.12. <hi>Neither by the blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us:</hi> So Chriſt is entred as the <hi>Great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> carrying the <hi>Great Sacrifice</hi> of his blood thither, and that waſheth us from our ſins Now is not here <hi>great ground</hi> for hope? That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is gone into Heaven as the <hi>Great Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> of that <hi>Great Sacrifice</hi> that purges away ſin, is <hi>within the vail,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all my hope of taking away ſin is <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt is entred within the vail as the <hi>righteous one:</hi> So you may ſee if you look into 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>My little children, If any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt who is the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93048:119"/>
                  <hi>righteous,</hi> is now with the Father; and that is <hi>within the vail,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as the <hi>Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> is <hi>within the vail,</hi> not onely the <hi>paſſive righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſts blood, but all the <hi>active righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, is <hi>within the vail;</hi> the <hi>paſſive righteouſneſs</hi> or Chriſt is that which juſtifies us from death eternal; and the <hi>active righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, that juſtifies the ſoul to life eternal, that is <hi>within the vail</hi> too, ſo that all that makes up our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> is <hi>within the vail;</hi> Chriſt the <hi>righteous one</hi> having all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to cover poor ſouls, hath perfectly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Law of God: This Jeſus Chriſt as the <hi>righteous one,</hi> is within the vail.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>righteous one, our Advocate,</hi> is within the vail; <hi>If any man ſin, wee have an Advocate with the Father;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>our Advocate</hi> is <hi>within the vail;</hi> hee lives to <hi>make Interceſſion</hi> for us, but where? there the Lord Chriſt <hi>makes Interceſſion</hi> where he now is, and that is in heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Chriſt is entred not into the holy place made with hands, but into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Chriſt is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin is given forth, whereby all <hi>gifts and grace</hi> is given forth to us, that whereby <hi>ſtrength</hi> againſt all our ſins is given forth; All this is <hi>within the vail:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> is <hi>within the vail</hi> to procure <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> againſt ſin, and what ever wee want, to have it ſupplied, all is <hi>within the vail,</hi> and is not here <hi>great ground</hi> for hope to found upon? if thou want any grace, ſtrength
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93048:119"/>againſt ſin, ſtill Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>our Advocate</hi> muſt give it forth, who is <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>all thoſe relations that hee ſtands in to his Children,</hi> is within the vail.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt hath all thoſe <hi>Relations</hi> he ſtood in here to his people, hee ſtands in the ſame to his people, in Heaven, as a <hi>head,</hi> Col. 1.18. <hi>Hee is the head of the body the Church.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was now in <hi>heaven,</hi> yet ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Hee is the head of the body the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And then Jeſus Chriſt is a <hi>Husband</hi> now <hi>within the vail,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>For I am jealous over you with a godly jealouſie, for I have eſpouſed you to one Husband.</hi> Chriſt is our Husband, though <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>our Brother,</hi> though <hi>within the vail, Joh.</hi> 20.17. the words of Chriſt after his Reſurrection to <hi>Mary, Go to my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> he owns his, under the title of <hi>Brethren</hi> after his Reſurrection: Look what Jeſus Chriſt was after his Reſurrection, that hee is for ever; for there is no alteration in Chriſt after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but Jeſus Chriſt after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a <hi>Brother</hi> to his Saints, and therefore is that for ever to his Saints: Jeſus Chriſt in all thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations he ſtands in them ſtill to his Saints: And what <hi>an abundant ground</hi> of hope is this, that we have one ſo near to us in Heaven <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Covenant of Grace that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vail;</hi> The bottome of a Chriſtians hope that is <hi>within the vail;</hi> The old <hi>Moſaical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> that was <hi>within the vail, Moſes</hi> carried his <hi>Covenant within</hi> the tipical <hi>vail,</hi> Heb. 9.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>The firſt Covenant had Ordinances of divine
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93048:120"/>ſervice, a worldly Sanctuary, and after the ſecond vail, the Tabernacle which is called the Holieſt of all, which had the golden Cenſer, and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had Manna, and</hi> Aarons <hi>rod that budded, and the tables of the Covenant:</hi> The <hi>tables of the Covenant,</hi> The old <hi>Moſaical Covenant</hi> was carried <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Moſes</hi> took his <hi>Covenant</hi> and carried it within the vail, ſo likewiſe Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Mediator of that <hi>New and better Covenant,</hi> he takes that <hi>Cavenant,</hi> and carries it <hi>within the vail:</hi> So that all that <hi>ground</hi> of hope that wee have from the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is the <hi>great bottome</hi> of a Chriſtians hope, all that is <hi>within the vail,</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt (as <hi>Moſes</hi>) took his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and carried it <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>All the promiſes of God are now within the vail,</hi> they are all treaſured and ſtored up within the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> is the <hi>grand Promiſe,</hi> and all the <hi>promiſes</hi> are in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> now the <hi>Covenant</hi> being <hi>within the vail,</hi> all the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God (<hi>every promiſe of grace,</hi> I would lay hold upon, and ground hope upon) are <hi>within the vail;</hi> ſo <hi>all the ground</hi> that can bee for a Chriſtians hope is <hi>within the vail:</hi> There is a <hi>certain foundation,</hi> his <hi>hope</hi> is carried into <hi>Heaven</hi> already, if pitcht upon Chriſt our <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner,</hi> the <hi>righteous one,</hi> the <hi>great Sacrifice,</hi> our <hi>Advocate,</hi> Chriſt in <hi>all his Relations,</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace, the <hi>promiſes,</hi> it is pitcht <hi>within the vaile;</hi> For all theſe are <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:93048:120"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Why a Chriſtians <hi>hope</hi> muſt bee fixed <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>Becauſe there is no ſafe anchoring place without the vail.</hi> All is quick-ſands (as I may ſay) take all the world, it is full of quick-ſands, any thing on this ſide Heaven is a quick-ſand, who ever caſts Anchor there, caſts Anchor upon a quick ſand; the only rock that will hold, is <hi>within the vail;</hi> therefore there is no Anchoring place but within the vail.</p>
               <p>I ſhall make ſome uſe.</p>
               <p>If it bee ſo, <hi>That the onely ground for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Anchor to bee fixed upon, is within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then this truth <hi>doth call upon many ſouls to remove their Anchors:</hi> Remove your <hi>Anchor</hi> of hope, or you are undone for ever: O there is many a ſoul grounds his hope ſome where elſe; Remove your <hi>Anchor,</hi> elſe aſſuredly, you will periſh for ever; If your <hi>Anchor</hi> bee caſt without the vail.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Art thou ſuch a one as <hi>reſts in morallity?</hi> Some have caſt their <hi>Anchor</hi> in the common rode of <hi>morallity</hi> and Civillity; that is, is the hope thou haſt for heaven grounded upon this? That thou art a <hi>Civil man,</hi> obſerveſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, walkeſt honeſtly and juſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thy neighbours, doing no body no hurt, and therefore thou hopeſt thou ſhalt go to Heaven: Is thy hope <hi>grounded</hi> upon any ſuch thing as this? As ſure as thou art here, thy hope is <hi>grounded without the vail,</hi> and thou wilt ſuffer ſhipwrack: Oh <hi>remove thy Anchor,</hi> this will never bee an <hi>Anchor-hold,</hi> thou mayeſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93048:121"/>hold a while, if there come a little <hi>blaſt,</hi> thou mayeſt hold as an Anchor upon the quick ſand, but when the <hi>great ſtorm</hi> comes, the tempeſt of death, thou wilt never hold it, having not a firm rock, it is on the ſands; if thou haſt ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this that thou art a <hi>Civil moral man,</hi> not ſo bad as others, others are worſe, and do not ſerve God ſo conſcionably as thou doſt, and therefore thou hopeſt God will ſave thee; O <hi>pluck up Anchor,</hi> caſt a new, for aſſuredly this is <hi>below the vail,</hi> it will never hold.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Art thou ſuch a one as haſt caſt thy <hi>Anchor of hope</hi> not onely in the <hi>common rode of Civillity and Morallity,</hi> but <hi>in the outward Court</hi> of <hi>Profeſſion?</hi> thou art not onely a <hi>Moral Civil man,</hi> but a <hi>great Profeſſor,</hi> haſt taken up a great profeſſion, prayes ever and anon, come and frequent meetings, or it may bee when thou comeſt home, prayes, read a Chapter, becauſe thou wilt do ſomething anſwerably to thy Profeſſion, and therefore thou hopeſt God will ſave thee: O is thy hope <hi>grounded</hi> upon this? Then <hi>pull up Anchor</hi> too, this is not <hi>within the vail,</hi> thou muſt <hi>weigh Anchor,</hi> for thou art yet ſhort of Heaven, below the <hi>vail,</hi> where a Saint caſts, <hi>Anchor,</hi> all this is below the <hi>vail;</hi> when a man reſts in his Profeſſion, praying, ſome good doings, thinks God ſhould ſave him for this, this is ſhort of the <hi>vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Is the <hi>Anchor of thy hope</hi> caſt <hi>in the Sanctuary,</hi> is it caſt (I mean) <hi>in the viſible Church?</hi> Is all thy hope for Heaven <hi>grounded</hi> upon this that thou art a <hi>Church-member,</hi> and art in the <hi>Church,</hi> therefore thou hopeſt thou
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93048:121"/>go to Heaven? What a <hi>Church-member</hi> go to Hell! I am a <hi>Church-member,</hi> therefore I ſhall go to Heaven: Is thy <hi>hope</hi> pitcht upon this that thou art in the Church? <hi>O pull up Anchor</hi> too, for thou art yet ſhort of the <hi>vail,</hi> thou haſt not yet <hi>caſt Anchor within the vail;</hi> If thou <hi>ground</hi> thy <hi>hope</hi> upon this, hopeſt God will ſave thee, bee merciful to thee, though thou haſt many failings, yet becauſe a <hi>Church member,</hi> got into the <hi>Church,</hi> before, conſcience troubled thee, but when got in to the Church, thou art at reſt, now I am well, now I am ſure for Heaven, ſettled, ſhall never fall, this is without the vail: For the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or <hi>holy place,</hi> which was a type of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> that was not the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> that was <hi>without the vail;</hi> So if thy hope for Heaven (Brethren and Siſters here of the Church, look where your hope is pitcht) if it bee grounded upon this, that I hope God will ſave mee, becauſe I am in the <hi>Church:</hi> O I tell thee, that thou mayeſt bee, and yet periſh for ever; thou mayeſt have thy hope <hi>grounded</hi> upon this, that thou art a <hi>Church-member,</hi> and yet no hope at all <hi>within the vail,</hi> but upon a ſandy foundation, and when a ſtorm comes, thou wilt ſuffer ſhipwrack, if a Church ſuffer not ſhipwrack for thee; If this bee the ground of thy <hi>hope,</hi> O go home, labour to <hi>pull up Anchor,</hi> and caſt thy <hi>Anchor</hi> upon that <hi>within the vail.</hi> This is not enough to bee in a <hi>Church-ſociety,</hi> as thoſe of old might come into the place of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and yet never come within the vail; ſo mayeſt thou, the Lord help us that wee may look to this, that our <hi>Anchor</hi> of <hi>hope</hi> bee pitched
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93048:122"/>
                  <hi>within the vail,</hi> bee grounded upon ſomething there, elſe it will not hold; it is not to walk in the Heatheniſh way of <hi>Morality,</hi> nor <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> nor <hi>holy place within the Sanctuary,</hi> it muſt bee <hi>within the vail;</hi> If thou art a <hi>moral man,</hi> not ſo bad as others; art thou one that hath made a <hi>profeſsion of Chriſt,</hi> and done ſomething an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, or art come into a <hi>viſible Church,</hi> art a <hi>Church-member,</hi> for the Lords ſake, go home, <hi>pluck up Anchor, pluck up</hi> ſuch <hi>hopes</hi> by the roots, as you love your ſouls, as you love your eternal ſouls, <hi>Pull up Anchor,</hi> or thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever, thou wilt ſurely ſuffer ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, my life for thine, if thou goeſt on, if thou Anchor here, if thou pitch not <hi>within the vail,</hi> thou wilt ſuffer ſhipwrack one day, thou wilt not hold when the ſtorm comes; but if thou haſt <hi>caſt Anchor</hi> upon Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Great Sacrifice,</hi> upon the blood of Jeſus, the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Jeſus; if thy hope bee ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Jeſus, the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of God, this is <hi>that foundation</hi> of hope <hi>within the vail,</hi> that will hold.</p>
               <p>Therefore go home, labour to pluck up your ſalfe hopes, and ſay Lord, Lord! Pitch, Pitch my <hi>Anchor</hi> of hope upon the <hi>blood</hi> of Jeſus, upon the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> upon the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt: J have all along hoped for Heaven upon ſomething <hi>without the vail;</hi> Lord, Lord, Come now, now, Pitch my <hi>Anchor</hi> upon this, <hi>within the vail;</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Interceſsion</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:93048:122"/>the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of God, ſuch things as theſe: ground thy hope for Heaven: If thou <hi>ground</hi> upon any other, thou wilt periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>And O how many are there, that if I ſhould aske, What is your hope built upon, O, ſaith one, I hope God will ſave mee, I am <hi>not ſo bad as ſuch and ſuch,</hi> I doe not live in ſuch ſinnes, I pray ſometimes, doe ſome good Duties; I hope God will ſave mee, I am a <hi>Church-member:</hi> Are your hopes <hi>grounded,</hi> pitched upon ſuch things as theſe? O you will periſh, if your hopes continue here, if they bee not pitched <hi>within the vail,</hi> there is the onely place where a Chriſtians hope is to <hi>Anchor;</hi> Nay, I am not to pitch my hope upon my <hi>Graces</hi> or <hi>Qualifications,</hi> though they are good, and things deſireable, to have as much grace as may bee, yet I muſt not pitch my hope upon this, that I finde an <hi>humble heart,</hi> a heart <hi>full of love</hi> to God, a <hi>broken heart,</hi> I muſt not <hi>Anchor</hi> my hope upon this, becauſe theſe are <hi>ſhort</hi> of the <hi>vaile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doe not ſay this is ſuch a foundation as the other, That a ſoule that pitches upon, ſhall ſplit his ſoule for ever, though God may ſave him, yet hee ſhall bee ſplit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his peace, comfort, aſſurance, day after day: If you ground your hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, That you have an <hi>humble, broken heart;</hi> It may bee to day thou findeſt an <hi>humble heart,</hi> but to morrow a <hi>proud heart:</hi> Where is <hi>thy hope</hi> now? Thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is ſplit, if thou <hi>groundeſt</hi> thy hope
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93048:123"/>upon this, that thou haſt a <hi>broken heart,</hi> to weep in this duty, and the other, but thou findeſt a heart like a <hi>ſtone</hi> in another; where is thy comfort now? If thou groundeſt it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy <hi>love to thy brother,</hi> it may bee to day thou loveſt him, to morrow thou art full of wrath, though thy hope ſhall not periſh for ever, though the foundation bee from God, though within us, from the Spirit of God, yet all the <hi>comfort</hi> thou takeſt from this, will bee ſplit, thou wilt bee undone in thy <hi>comfort</hi> for a time, therefore the <hi>onely ground</hi> for our hope muſt be <hi>within the vail;</hi> Let this then ſtir up every one <hi>to pitch their Anchor within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Art thou ſuch a one as hath thy <hi>Anchor</hi> yet to caſt? That is one that hath no hope, not from any thing at all; or one that hath ſome hope it may bee from <hi>Profeſsion, Civility,</hi> or <hi>Church-memberſhip.</hi> O labour now to pitch thy hope upon ſomething <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will onely ſhew you a few things by way of motive from the conſideration of that <hi>glorious place within the vail,</hi> it would incourage any one to caſt their <hi>Anchor</hi> of hope there, there are ſo many <hi>gloious things</hi> to bee injoyed there.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider within the vail (that is in heaven) there is the <hi>bleſſed preſence of God to bee ſeen for ever:</hi> There is the Beatifical viſion, beholding of God for ever and ever, it is within the vail; there is the beholding God as a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled God for ever and ever, there they ſhall ſee God face to face, behold all the glory of God, not a little, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t fully, and perfectly.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:93048:123"/>
               <p>Secondly, Within the vail there is <hi>full partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of God:</hi> A poor ſoul that caſts his hope <hi>within the vail,</hi> there hee ſhall come to partake of God, of the love of God; there hee ſhall not have it by drops as now, but it ſhall come ſtreaming forth; wee are here to pray that wee may bee filled with all the fulneſs of God, there wee ſhall have the anſwer of this prayer, in being filled with all the fulneſs of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is <hi>the ſociety of all the bleſſed Saints and Angels:</hi> There is ſociety and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Saints and Angels, all the Saints of God, they ſhall ſee them <hi>within the vail;</hi> and what a bleſſed thing is it to have ſociety with all the bleſſed glorified Saints, and all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels together? There are all the Saints wee knew here, all that are Saints wee ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them all together there, there wee ſhall come to the General Aſſembly of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There are <hi>many glorious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Freedomes, and Immunities there, that are not to bee injoyed any where elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 There is <hi>freedome from ſin,</hi> not onely free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the <hi>power and dominion</hi> of ſin; O but there is freedome from the <hi>appearance</hi> of ſin, thou ſhalt bee rid of all thy corruptions, when thou goeſt <hi>within the vail,</hi> ſhalt ſhake them all off, there is not one ſin, nor corruption can bee carried with thee thither; the poor ſoul that hath been buffeted and beaten under his corruption, and cryed out, <hi>I ſhall periſh one day,</hi> when thou comeſt <hi>within the vail,</hi> there ſhall
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93048:124"/>bee freedome from all theſe; every one left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and thou ſhalt go a pure ſpotleſs ſoul, without any ſinne ſticking to thee; O who would not go to ſuch a place, caſt their <hi>Anchor</hi> there?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Within the vail there is <hi>freedome from all ſtings and torments of conſcience;</hi> There ſhall bee peace, bleſſed peace, for ever and ever, and nothing but peace ſhall the poor ſoul injoy: Conſcience <hi>within the vail,</hi> is altogether a friend, ſometimes here, conſcience appeares as an enemy, but there conſcience ſhall bee a continual friend, everlaſtingly ſpeake for thee, beare witneſſe for thee for ever: O how is a ſoule <hi>tormented with ſtings of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> many times? Take a poore carnal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how is hee tormented with ſtings of conſcience? O! but if ſuch a poore ſoule could pitch his <hi>Anchor within the vaile,</hi> hee ſhould finde a great deale of the <hi>ſting</hi> taken off here for the preſent, and wholly at that day when hee comes <hi>within the vaile;</hi> There is nothing but peace, peace, there.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There is <hi>freedome from all Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Temptations of Satan;</hi> when <hi>within the vaile,</hi> the Devill ſhall never accuſe more, hee cannot come there, never tempt more. Now what violent Temptations are wee under? One while tempted to one ſinne, another while to another; but then wee ſhall bee free from all, never tempted, to diſtruſt the Grace of God more, never tempted to unbeleefe more, never tempted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93048:124"/>to murmure againſt God more, never tempted to bee proud more, <hi>Temptations</hi> ceaſe within the vaile; Thou ſhalt leave all that is evill on this ſide the <hi>vaile;</hi> never ſhall a poore ſoule meet with a <hi>Temptation</hi> there.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Within the vaile is <hi>freedome from all perſecution, and ſcoffes, and reproaches:</hi> There ſhall bee no cruell <hi>Cain,</hi> to kill his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no perſecuting <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> no reproach of Saints there, but altogether bleſſing <hi>within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Within the vaile ſhall bee <hi>freedome from all afflictions and ſorrowes that lye upon thee here:</hi> Here are <hi>Afflictions, Trials</hi> and <hi>Sorrowes,</hi> while wee are here on this ſide the <hi>Vaile;</hi> but when a poore ſoule commeth <hi>within the Vaile,</hi> there ſhall bee no more <hi>Sorrow,</hi> nor <hi>Crying,</hi> nor <hi>Weeping,</hi> nor any more <hi>paine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If that bee true in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> much more true <hi>within the Vaile,</hi> no more <hi>affliction, trouble,</hi> nor <hi>griefe</hi> of heart, all theſe things ſhall bee left on this ſidethe <hi>Vaile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 There ſhall bee <hi>freedome from all Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Soule or Body, of Nature, or Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many <hi>Imperfections</hi> of Nature wee have here, and many <hi>Imperfections</hi> of Grace; O! but when wee come <hi>within the Vaile,</hi> there ſhall bee no <hi>Imperfection</hi> of Nature, nor of Grace, but <hi>all perfect;</hi> no <hi>Imperfection</hi> in the Soule, nor in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93048:125"/>the body, the body ſhall bee like the <hi>glorious body</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. laſt, and then the ſoul ſhall bee <hi>perfect,</hi> as Heb. 12.23, <hi>To the ſpirits of the juſt men made perfect;</hi> O then ſoul and body ſhall bee treed from <hi>all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> And is not this a bleſſed place to <hi>caſt Anchor</hi> in, where are ſuch bleſſed things to bee injoyed?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, There ſhall be <hi>feedome from all ſubjection and ſuperiority:</hi> There ſhall bee no <hi>ſubjection</hi> ariſing from any relation, as here; the wife not ſubject to the Husband, ſervant to Maſter, children to Parents, inferiours to Superiours, all ſhall bee <hi>equall within the vail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, Then within the vail there ſhall bee <hi>freedome from death it ſelf, then death ſhall bee ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.54. There ſhall bee <hi>no more death there;</hi> A wicked mans death is an eternal death, becauſe hee is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vail,</hi> therefore an eternal death; but a Saints death who pitches his <hi>Anchor</hi> of hope <hi>within the vail,</hi> that is an entrance into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, as ſoon as his death hath put him <hi>within the vail,</hi> then death is ſwallowed up, there ſhall be no more death, death doth but put him <hi>within the vail,</hi> into eternal life; What <hi>glorious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are within the Vail?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Again, within the vail there is a <hi>glorious inheritance to bee injoyed, a Kingdome</hi> is prepared for all thoſe that enter there, thoſe that <hi>cast Anchor</hi> there, before hand, have a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> there ready for them againſt they come there, and that is called the <hi>Inheritance of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93048:125"/>Saints in light,</hi> a glorious Inheritance, therefore our hope is called an <hi>Anchor,</hi> becauſe the exerciſe of the <hi>grace of hope</hi> is chiefly about our <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; Faith</hi> is about the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> our <hi>hope</hi> is about the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and it is pitched upon the <hi>Inheritance</hi> before hand: If you <hi>caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor</hi> within the vail, you <hi>caſt Anchor</hi> upon a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> a <hi>glorious Inheritance,</hi> which when thou comeſt there ſhall bee thine, a bleſſed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Inheritance,</hi> a Crown of glory: <hi>Henceforth is laid up for mee a Crown of glory,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> O who would not <hi>caſt Anchor</hi> there, that ſhall <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor</hi> upon a <hi>Kingdome?</hi> Who would <hi>caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor</hi> without the vail, and bee contented one minute, when by <hi>caſting Anchor</hi> within the vail, hee ſhall have a <hi>glorious Inheritance</hi> made his for ever?</p>
               <p n="6">6 Within the vail there is <hi>immediate feeding and teaching:</hi> Within the Moſaical vail in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. there was the <hi>golden Pot that had Manna,</hi> the Pot of Manna was to ſhew that <hi>immediate feeding,</hi> whereby the people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were immediately fed from God in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; This argues when we come within the vail, there ſhall bee <hi>immediate feeding</hi> from God, and hee in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them; then they ſhall never have a hungry ſoul for God more, the ſoul ſhall have its fill from Jeſus Chriſt, there is <hi>immediate feeding,</hi> and it was <hi>precious feeding,</hi> that Manna was ſweet as honey; ſo ſhall the <hi>feeding within the vail,</hi> bee ſweet precious feeding.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Within the vail there is <hi>extraordinary growth:</hi> It is the complaint of a Chriſtian
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93048:126"/>here, O I grow but a little, I finde little or no growth; O poor ſoul, doſt thou grow but a little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſt Anchor <hi>within the Vail,</hi> and thou ſhalt finde <hi>extraordinary growth</hi> within the Vail: There was <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> that budded in one night, it budded &amp; brought forth Almonds, and all in a night, here was <hi>extraordinary growth,</hi> this Rod was <hi>within the Vail;</hi> When ſouls come <hi>within the Vail,</hi> they ſhall not <hi>grow</hi> by little and little, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>grow</hi> (as they think) backward, but <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary growth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 Within the Vaile is <hi>Stability:</hi> Within the Vail is the <hi>Covenant:</hi> Now the <hi>Covenant</hi> is that upon which our <hi>ſtrength</hi> is founded, for by <hi>Grace yee ſtand,</hi> by the Covenant of Grace you ſtand; now the <hi>Covenant</hi> upon which our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is founded is <hi>within the Vail;</hi> you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall from that condition, who would not <hi>caſt Anchor</hi> within the Vail?</p>
               <p>O bee more in the exerciſe of this <hi>Grace of hope:</hi> It is one thing I have obſerved, of all the three great Graces, <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> wee are leaſt in the exerciſe of the grace of <hi>Hope;</hi> wee look to exerciſe <hi>Faith,</hi> to goe out to the Promiſes, and to exerciſe <hi>Charity,</hi> but <hi>Hope,</hi> which is the middle grace, wee are apt to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, if hope bee not exerciſed in ſome meaſure, faith will bee dead, and charity dead; Now the work of <hi>hope</hi> is to look to the <hi>glorious Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;</hi> to the <hi>reward</hi> which one day wee ſhall enjoy; be much in the exerciſe of the grace of <hi>hope,</hi> look upon the <hi>reward,</hi> God would have us look to it, hath left one grace to bee <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed</hi> about it, look at the mark of the price
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93048:126"/>of the high Calling; I do not ſay you ſhould work altogether for it, but look on it for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, what a <hi>glorious Inheritance</hi> you ſhall poſſeſs one day, after you have done the will of God here, for you ſhall receive the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> and what is this Promiſe? the promiſe of an <hi>eternal Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how doth this incourage a poor ſoul! it is but a little while, and I ſhall receive the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> that <hi>glorious Inheritance:</hi> Exerciſe this Grace of <hi>Hope,</hi> which lyes in <hi>Expectation;</hi> let us not lay by our <hi>Hope,</hi> and thinke it enough to exerciſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and let <hi>Hope</hi> lye by that ſhould help on both; It is the <hi>Anchor</hi> that holds us faſt, and makes us ſteady, it graſps the <hi>Inheritance</hi> before hand, and holds us to it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words read unto you, are a part of (and indeed the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of) that ſweet and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sermon which our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt made to his Diſciples, when hee was taking his farewell of them to go to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Two things there are, which Jeſus Chriſt ſeems now upon his departure to have a deep ſenſe of:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Leſt his Diſciples in the time of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>ſhould bee bereaved of their inward peace and conſolation;</hi> to prevent which, hee layes them in, in this his laſt Sermon, many ſweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul-ſtrengthning Cordials.</item>
                  <item>2 Leſt through their weakneſs (they being as yet but little children, as hee terms them in the foregoing verſe, amongſt whom wrangling and jarring is not onely natural, but a cuſtome) <hi>ſhould in the time of his abſence fall at oddes and variance within themſelves.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:93048:128"/>
               <p>For prevention of which, he no ſooner minds them of his departure, but hee layes a ſtreight charge upon them, that as they did love him, or regard his honour before men, they would be eſpecially carefull, that there might be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion or want of affection among them when he ſhould be gone: Which charge of his, that it might ſinke deep into their memories, he gives it over and over, as in our Text; and again, Chap. 15.12. and again verſ. 17. Yea that they might ſee how exceedingly his minde did run upon this, and how the fear of their failing herein, did (as it were) ſtick in his heart, conſidering they were as yet but little children, and therefore very liable to fall together by the ears, he layes down this, as the firſt and great thing of all, that he would have them to minde in his abſence. <hi>A New Commandement</hi> — (firſt Commands (as in the Commands of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law) are greateſt) as if he ſhould ſay, Little children, a little while I am with you, and then I am to leave you; and O it fears mee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly! that no ſooner ſhall I be gone, but you will be together by the ears; and therefore, as the firſt thing of all, and one main thing that I would have you alwaies to remember, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, yea I command you, minde this, to <hi>love one another.</hi> I am extreamly afraid of the contrary, and therefore I charge you, <hi>Love one another, Love one another. A NEW</hi>—</p>
               <p>The onely Query neceſſary for the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, is this, why the Command of Love, is here called, <hi>A New Commandement,</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:93048:128"/>ſeeing it is ancient, as ancient as the Law of God, the whole Law being comprehended in this word <hi>LOVE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To omit the various reaſons which are given of the thing, that which I conceive to bee moſt conſonant to Truth, and moſt agreeable to Scripture-language, is this, becauſe <hi>This duty of love is more clearly revealed, more fully diſcovered, and more frequently preſſed in the New Teſtament, than ever it was in the Old.</hi> Though it be certain, the Law in the ſecond Table thereof required <hi>love to the Brethren,</hi> yet did it not ſo clearly and particularly reveal and preſſe the ſame, as wee have it revealed and preſſed under the Goſpel. And thus in reſpect of more clear revelation, it may be called, <hi>A New Commandement,</hi> as the Covenant of Grace, which from firſt, to laſt, is one and the ſame, in reſpect of the more cleare adminiſtration thereof, is in Scripture called, <hi>A New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>It is the Command (one of the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) of Jeſus Chriſt, that Saints ſhould love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None I ſuppoſe will queſtion the truth of this, if they doe, let them read over the place fore-quoted, together with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.1. and the Epiſtles of <hi>John,</hi> where this is plentifully urged. One place for all may ſerve, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 23. where the Apoſtle ſummes up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel into two Great Commands, whereof, the firſt is <hi>faith</hi> in the Son God, the ſecond, is <hi>love</hi> to the Brethren.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:93048:129"/>
               <p>In proſecution of this, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1 What <hi>great ground and reaſon</hi> there is why Saints ſhould <hi>love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 How Saints may have <hi>their hearts brought up to the practice</hi> of this duty, <hi>to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Anſwer <hi>ſome Objections</hi> which lye in the way of many as obſtacles and impediments, whereby they are hindred from the exerciſe of this precious grace, and ſo great and neceſſary a duty of <hi>love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, I may ſay, That there is <hi>all the reaſon</hi> in the world, why Saints <hi>ſhould love one another.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 I ſhall begin with my Obſervation, and make that a reaſon of it ſelf, <hi>becauſe it is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, That Saints ſhould love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Which, ſhould I do no other but repeat over and over, you ſhould ſee reaſon enough for the thing. The Command of a Father, is enough with a dutifull Son; The will of the Husband with a loving wife; And ſo the Command of Chriſt, had wee nothing elſe, ſhould bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient with thoſe who profeſs themſelves to bee dutifull Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To this Command of Chriſt, wee have added <hi>his own example,</hi> which may bee a ſecond reaſon why <hi>Saints ſhould love one another,</hi> Chriſt bids us learn of him, and bee followers of him; how will you ever do this Chriſtians? if you <hi>love</hi> not one another as hee hath loved you all.

                  <hi>This is my Commandement, that

               <p n="3">3 <hi>Saints are in near relation one to another:</hi> How near? (<hi>Abraham</hi> made this an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Lot,</hi> why there ſhould bee no ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, We are <hi>Brethren</hi>) Why as near as <hi>Brother,</hi> and <hi>Brother,</hi> for they are <hi>Brethren,</hi> as near as members of the ſame body, for they are <hi>all one body:</hi> It is almoſt a wonder in Nature to ſee members of the ſame body fighting one with another, to ſee the hands beating of the feet, and the feet ſpurning and trampling of the hands; wee conclude when wee ſee a man do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, that hee is not himſelf, hee hath the frenzie. So it is a wonder in it ſelf (though in our dayes none) to ſee <hi>Saints fighting one with another,</hi> one throwing cudgels at the other, and the other at him; certainly were Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would not do it. When one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber woundeth and bruiſeth another, that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that doth it becauſe, it is of the body, feels the ſmart as well as that to whom it is done. So when one Saint wounds another, let him look to it: If hee bee a Saint indeed, and of the body, hee himſelf will one day or other (though perhaps at preſent hee doth not) feele the ſmart and anguiſh of every blow and wound hee hath given his brother; if hee bee not of the body, you know whether he will then, I need not tell you.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:93048:130"/>

               <p>Now there is not a Saint, but hee is <hi>beholding</hi> to other Saints, <hi>beholding</hi> to them for their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O that ſuch who make it their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice to rail upon, and revile their <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> would thinke of this. It may be there is not a day thou riſeſt, but thou faireſt the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that Saint, and thoſe Saints thou frowneſt upon, and ſpeakeſt evill of; perhaps hee may have been with his Father, putting up peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for thee even at that inſtant wherein thou art reproaching and caſting dirt upon him; and O! wilt thou for ſhame requite him thus for his <hi>love?</hi> If <hi>brotherly love</hi> be wanting, is there no ingenuity neither? And how knoweſt thou, but it may bee that, which if it be, how ill doſt thou thinke will thy heavenly Father take this at thy hands?

So —</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Love is debt,</hi> Rom. 13.8. <hi>Owe no man any thing but this, to love one another, for he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the Law.</hi> If he be not an honeſt man that will not pay his debts, what ſhall we call them Saints that will not <hi>love their brethren?</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Breach of love, is the breach of the whole Law,</hi> Rom. 13.8, 9, 10. The neglect of ſome duties break <hi>one</hi> Commandement, the neglect of others, <hi>another:</hi> but the neglect of <hi>love</hi> breaks <hi>all.</hi> Judge then what a ſinner hee that will not <hi>love his Brother,</hi> is.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>Wicked men love one another.</hi> Is there any good to be learned from a bad man? Yes, this the Saints themſelves may learn to <hi>love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for ſo do they.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And laſtly, There are <hi>many duties which lye in common between the Saints, which they are bound to performe one to another;</hi> Which they can never do, if <hi>love</hi> bee wanting, as comforting, edifying, relieving, reprooving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 How <hi>Saints may have their heart brought up to the practice</hi> of this duty of Love.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Love Saints as they are Saints,</hi> I ſay, <hi>as they are Saints,</hi> not as they are of this, or that party, for my opinion or againſt it, but as <hi>they are Saints,</hi> thou wilt never <hi>love</hi> as thou ſhouldeſt do, till thou loveſt <hi>Saints as Saints,</hi> as they have the Image of God upon them, Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt in them, which is the onely thing <hi>lovely</hi> in all, and for which all are to bee loved. I am not when I ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>love,</hi> to ask the queſtion concerning the party to bee loved, is hee ſuch a one
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93048:131"/>or ſuch a one, of this opinion, or that, high, or low in the world, of little parts, or great parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, but is hee a Saint, or not, a <hi>new creature,</hi> or not; Hath hee the <hi>Image of God</hi> upon him or not? If ſo, let him bee what hee will for any of the other, I muſt <hi>love him,</hi> and it is my duty to <hi>love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas, in our dayes, the queſtion is, Is hee ſuch a one, or ſuch a one, then I will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with him; what though hee bee a Saint? Men are not ſo mad to ſay ſo, but their practice ſhews it. What a ridiculous thing would it bee, if a man ſhould ſend his Son to a dear and intimate Friend of his, and his Friend before ever hee would admit him into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or own him to have ſociety with him, ſhould put out twenty foppiſh queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, what is hee? is he ſickly, or well, a youth, or a man grown, beautiful, or deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? hath he brown hair, or black? To ask is he my Friends Son? were a beſeeming queſtion, but to ſtand asking and delaying upon the other, would bee extreamly fooliſh, and that which might well make an A, B, C, boy laugh at him. So <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —</p>
               <p>Would you <hi>love aright,</hi> love <hi>Saints as Saints,</hi> Do not ſay, Is he rich, or of parts, I will love him? Is he for my opinion, I will love him, if not, let him bee as holy as hee will, I will hate him, and revile, and ſpeak evil of him; No, no, <hi>Love all as Saints.</hi> Let mee tell you, Hee that <hi>loves another,</hi> for parts, <hi>loves</hi> him for ſomething of the creature, for parts are ſuch; hee that <hi>loves another</hi> for his opinion, <hi>loves</hi> him for himſelf,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93048:131"/>for hee loves himſelf, and his opinion in the man: But he that <hi>loves another,</hi> becauſe hee is a <hi>Saint,</hi> and hath the <hi>Image</hi> of God upon him, hee <hi>loves</hi> him purely for Gods ſake.</p>
               <p>Now to ſet this truth upon our hearts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>If ever thou wouldeſt have God to own thy love, love Saints as Saints.</hi> God will own no other <hi>love,</hi> though it go currant on earth, it will not in Heaven. Chriſt at the laſt day owns onely that <hi>love</hi> ſhewn to <hi>Saints at Saints,</hi> to the leaſt of Saints, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Think you not that there were many at Chriſts left hand at this day, who had <hi>loved</hi> great Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet Chriſt owns not their <hi>love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>If ever thou wouldeſt have the comfort of thy love, love Saints as Saints:</hi> The Devil will finde ſome flaw in thy <hi>love;</hi> let it run in what channel it will, if not in this; he will ſay when thou wouldeſt take comfort from thy <hi>love,</hi> that thou didſt not <hi>love</hi> ſuch a one becauſe a <hi>Saint,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was of thy opinion, or rich, or of great gifts, and parts.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>If ever thou wouldeſt love as God loves, love Saints as Saints.</hi> God <hi>loves</hi> his people out of no other reſpect, but as they are <hi>Saints,</hi> as he ſees his image upon them. As a Father <hi>loves</hi> his childe out of no other reſpect ſo much as this, as he is his childe, not ſo much becauſe of his ſhape, or part, little or great, a Boy or Girle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſaith a Father, This is my childe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I <hi>love</hi> him; ſaith God, This is my childe, he hath my image upon him, and therefore I <hi>love</hi> him: If thou wouldeſt <hi>love as God loves,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:93048:132"/>look at nothing in the world ſo much in thoſe whom thou <hi>loveſt</hi> as whether they bee Saints or no. I had rather <hi>love</hi> a man, and hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, who differs in a hundred things from mee, if I ſee in him the <hi>Image</hi> of God, and the Spirit of a Saint, than he that jumps with mee in every tittle, if this bee wanting, I had rather <hi>love</hi> a man that can ſpeak but ten words, and hath in him the power of what hee ſpeakes, and is humble withall, than hee that can utter ten thouſand curious notions, and is proud, and ſelf-conceited therewith, wanting the power of them all; becauſe ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhould <hi>love as God loves,</hi> and hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as God holds communion.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>If ever thou wouldeſt love here, as thou ſhalt love in Heaven hereafter, love Saints as Saints,</hi> There are many ſouls, who if ever God bring them to <hi>Heaven,</hi> will <hi>love</hi> their brethren in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guiſe way than now they do; then they ſhall not flye one on the back of another, and one bee ready to kick another out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſaying, You are <hi>ſuch a one,</hi> and the other him, and you are <hi>ſuch a one;</hi> No, then they ſhall bee aſhamed of ſuch childiſh tricks, as a grown man is aſhamed to thinke of what trickes hee plaid when hee was a childe, how hee ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one brother, and becauſe hee was but a little croſſed in his will, laid another croſs the pate.</p>
               <p>No, then Saints ſhall <hi>love Saints, as Saints;</hi> Then ſhall one ſay, <hi>I love</hi> thee becauſe I ſee the <hi>Image</hi> of my Father in thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of my Father upon thee; And then
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93048:132"/>ſhall the other ſay, and I <hi>love</hi> thee for this, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Now from what hath been ſaid, of <hi>loving Saints as Saints,</hi> that you and I may practice it; let us endeavour to have our hearts brought up to <hi>love</hi> theſe four <hi>ſorts of Saints,</hi> and ſo we ſhall <hi>love Saints as Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Love little Saints.</hi> See Chriſts care of little ones, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. how will hee take it at the hands of thoſe who ſhall receive them, Verſ. 5. How ill hee takes it from them who offend them, Verſe 6. How carefull he is, that they may not be deſpiſed. Verſ. 10. And how carefull his Father is of their ſalvation. Verſ. 14. Yea <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. When Chriſt paſſeth ſentence, hee abſolves, or condemns men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they behaved themſelves towards the <hi>leaſt</hi> of his Saints, either in doing, or not doing for them. Verſ. 40.45. Chriſt doth not ſay, In as much as you have done, or not done, thus and thus, for Sir ſuch a one, and Maſter ſuch a one my ſervant; But in as much as you have done, or not done thus or thus, to one of the <hi>leaſt</hi> of theſe.</p>
               <p>Saints that goe in their Scarlet Coat, in their Silkes, and Velvet, many will <hi>love,</hi> but yet they <hi>love</hi> not <hi>Saints as Saints:</hi> Wouldeſt thou <hi>love Saints as Saints,</hi> labour to <hi>love</hi> Grace in the Grey Coat, Leather Coat, as much as in any other.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Love <hi>Saints in their loweſt condition.</hi> If thou haſt loved a Saint, when the world and friends favoured him, ſee thou <hi>loveſt</hi> him as much when all theſe frown upon him.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:93048:133"/>
               <p n="3">3 Love <hi>contrary minded Saints:</hi> It is nothing to <hi>love</hi> a man that will ſpeak as I ſpeak, and do as I do.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Love <hi>offending Saints,</hi> I am to forgive him, and I can never heartily forgive him, if I doe not <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.21, 12. <hi>Peter</hi> thought ſeven times a great matter, Chriſt bids him <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his brother</hi> ſeventy times ſeven, to teach us that many offences ſhould not break the <hi>band of love</hi> amongſt Saints.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all concerning this, with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10, 11. where he tells us, that in the New creature, there is neither <hi>Greek,</hi> not <hi>Jew, i.e.</hi> Men are not to be conſidered as of this Nation, or that, <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or <hi>Uncircumeiſion,</hi> of this opinion, or that, theſe were ſo great contrary opinions in thoſe dayes, or as enjoying outward priviledges, or wanting them, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was accounted a great priviledge to thoſe that had it. <hi>Barbarian, Scythian,</hi> as they are rude, illiterate, or clowniſh perſons, as the <hi>Barbarians, Scythians,</hi> were a rude people: <hi>Bond,</hi> or <hi>Free,</hi> that is, a Maſter or ſervant, in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or out; <hi>But Chriſt is all, and in all, i.e.</hi> Chriſt is all we are to look at, and it is Chriſt in all wee are to look at, all are to be looked at as they are in Chriſt, <hi>as Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Love though thou are not loved.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul loved,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.15. There was <hi>abundant love</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> heart to them, though little in theirs to him, Yea the leſſe in theirs, the more in his.</p>
               <p>It is the practice of moſt, they will <hi>love</hi> onely ſo far, and ſo long as they ſee themſelves beloved, and therefore upon any ſuſpicion of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93048:133"/>theirs, that their <hi>Brothers love</hi> declines towards them, theirs immediately cools towards him, and that is an evill which both ſpeaker and hearers, have too much their ſhares in; whereas the contrary is our duty, who ever I look upon as a Saint, I ſhould <hi>love</hi> him, though he <hi>love</hi> not mee, I ſhould not only <hi>love</hi> him when hee <hi>loves</hi> mee, honours mee, ſpeaks well of mee, but when hee doth the contrary; that ſo ſhould his <hi>love</hi> quite dye towards mee, yet mine might bee as hot and lively towards him as ever; now to do this, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That <hi>I ſhall give an account not of my Brothers love to mee, but of my love to my Brother.</hi> Chriſt will not ask mee, did your Brother <hi>love</hi> you? but did you <hi>love</hi> your Brother? if hee <hi>love</hi> not mee, let him look to that, hee ſhall anſwer for that, but if I <hi>love</hi> not him, let mee look to that, I ſhall anſwer for that; if hee will walk ſo, as to give his account with ſadneſſe, ſhall I do ſo too? It is ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. That <hi>love</hi> gives us bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the day of Judgement, how ſo? which will abſolve or condemn, (as I ſaid before) as men have behaved themſelves towards his Saints, in <hi>loving,</hi> or <hi>not loving</hi> them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as have been more <hi>full of love,</hi> ſhall <hi>more boldly</hi> appear at that day.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That <hi>my ſpiritual comfort lies not in my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love to mee, but in my love to my Brother;</hi> What <hi>comfort</hi> were it, though all the men in the world ſhould <hi>love</hi> a Saint; if this were all, it were poor <hi>comfort.</hi> But now if I can <hi>love a Saint,</hi> becauſe it is my Fathers will I ſhould, when yet hee <hi>loves not</hi> mee; what comfort is here? when
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93048:134"/>the heart can as'twere ſay, I <hi>love</hi> thee Brother, becauſe thou art a Saint, hate mee as much as thou wilt, I care not for it, for I am reſolved to <hi>love</hi> thee, becauſe thou art a <hi>Saint,</hi> whether thou wilt or no.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That <hi>the excellency of love lies in this, in loving my brother, when he loves not mee;</hi> to <hi>love</hi> when I am <hi>loved</hi> is no <hi>excellent love,</hi> this is only to do as Publicans do, as wicked men may, there is no <hi>ſingular thing</hi> in this. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.46, 47.</p>
               <p n="4">4 My <hi>love comes neareſt to Gods love, when I love, but am not loved;</hi> God loved us when hee was not loved of us, before we loved him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may do this, take this rule (for in truthes of this nature we muſt have precept upon precept, and line upon line, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks) <hi>ever make this the ground of thy love to thy brother, that thou art beloved of God, and becauſe thou art beloved of God, therefore thou wilt love thy brother;</hi> ſay ſoul, when thy Brother hates thee, I am <hi>beloved</hi> of God, my Brother hates me, but I am <hi>beloved</hi> of God, he ſpeaks evil of me, but I am <hi>beloved</hi> of God, and becauſe I am <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> of God, and that God that <hi>loves</hi> mee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to love my brother, therefore I will <hi>love</hi> him, though he <hi>love</hi> not me. This <hi>John</hi> lays down as the ground of our <hi>love</hi> to our brethren, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.11. <hi>If God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Account thy ſelf leaſt of Saints, and judge every one better than thy ſelf.</hi> Thus did <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 3. and this <hi>rule Paul</hi> lays down to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine love amongſt the Philippians, <hi>Let each one
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93048:134"/>eſteeme others better than themſelves,</hi> Phil. 2.3. My Brethren, you know it (for it is an evil that at one time or other we ſhall all of us finde in our own hearts) that it I do but ſee a little <hi>more love</hi> expreſſed to another than my ſelf, I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ready to think that another hath <hi>all the love,</hi> and that I am <hi>not loved</hi> at all, and ſo am ready to hate both the party that <hi>loves,</hi> and the party that is <hi>loved.</hi> Now, whence comes this but only hence, I am of a proud and filthy Self-conceit, think my ſelf better than another, and that therefore I deſerve <hi>more love</hi> than he, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as did I account every one <hi>better</hi> than my ſelf, then when the caſe is thus, I ſhould reaſon thus: What though ſuch a one be <hi>loved better</hi> than I? and ſuch a Brother <hi>love</hi> him better, yet is there no reaſon that I ſhould be offended either with him that <hi>loves,</hi> or him that is <hi>loved,</hi> becauſe he that is loved is <hi>better</hi> than I, and ſo deſerves <hi>more love</hi> than me, I will not therefore be angry with my Brother becauſe he <hi>loves</hi> him better than I, nor envie him becauſe he is ſo <hi>loved,</hi> but I will ever honour <hi>love,</hi> and prize both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now, that thou maiſt come to look upon thy ſelf as the leaſt of Saints; conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The <hi>opportunities and means thou haſt had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others:</hi> Say, yonder is a poor Saint, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have more than he, yet if I conſider the opportunities and means I have had, which hee hath wanted, in this reſpect I have leſs; I have had the Word plentifully in the power and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it taught, been in Church fellowſhip ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, he poor ſoul hath wanted all this, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93048:135"/>yet how lively is he? had he had <hi>my opportunities</hi> he would have been ten times better than I.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The time thou haſt had:</hi> ſay, I have been ten, twenty, thirty, forty years in Chriſts Schoole, and yet what a Sot am I, what a dead heart have I? yonder is one but of yeſterday, a year, two year old in grace, and yet how farre is he got, and fair on the way to get before mee already.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>ſeveral ways God hath taken to make thee grow;</hi> one while I have been afflicted in my body, another while in my eſtate, I have loſt ſuch a ſhip, &amp;c. another while in my Children, ſuch a Childe loſt, &amp;c. yet after all, I am as carnal as ever; O had God taken ſo many ways with ſuch and ſuch, there would have been other fruit of it in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Rule.

A <hi>Spiritual heart</hi> hath ſo many admirable objects to employ its ſelf and time about, that hee findes no leaſure to brawl with, or to buffet his Brother; as, take a man that hath his head taken up with high things, a noble ſpirited man, let him paſs the ſtreets and one laughs at him, another miſcalls him, hee takes no notice of it; but now, take a low ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited man, and if they grin at him, hee'l grin at them; miſcall him, hee'l miſcall them: this comes from the lowneſs and baſeneſs of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo here-hence comes our diviſions, hence
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93048:135"/>our ſtrife. Chriſtians are of low and childiſh ſpirits, and we know it is a very ordinary thing for Children to wrangle and fall together by the ears in their Fathers houſe, but grown men wont do ſo. Would you <hi>maintain love?</hi> get your hearts exerciſed with <hi>ſpiritual things:</hi> if thou art one who art of a wrangling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious ſpirit, it is a ſign thou haſt an idle heart, thou doſt little; as Boys whilſt they are in the School at their Books they'l agree, but turn them out to play, though but half an hour, they'l be together by the ears: ſo here.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Walk wiſely.</hi> A great part, or the greateſt part of thoſe differences which are amongſt Saint, ariſe from <hi>indiſcretion. Indiſcretion</hi> it is the mother of ſtrife and diviſion. Had but we <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wiſdome,</hi> how to walk and behave our ſelves towards each other, though there are many corruptions in our hearts, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would divide us, yet this would prevent it: had wee wiſdome there would bee <hi>oneneſs</hi> of heart and affection, though there bee <hi>difference</hi> in judgement and opinion. And therefore it is not in vaine, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks ſo much of <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and preſſeth beleevers on ſo much to <hi>walk wiſely; Wiſdome</hi> would make up many a breach which folly opens. I have known Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whoſe principles in many things have differed one from another, and in ſome ſmaller matters their practices too, who yet have <hi>walked</hi> through <hi>wiſdome</hi> given to them, with ſo much <hi>love</hi> and tenderneſs, and ſweetneſs each to other, as none could think by their carriage each to other, that there were the <hi>leaſt difference</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93048:136"/>them, ſo much <hi>love,</hi> tenderneſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. as if there were no difference at all: now would we have and maintaine <hi>love?</hi> then <hi>walk wiſely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walk wiſely</hi> in admonitions and reproofs; if thou art one who mayeſt reprove with more <hi>authority</hi> than another may, doe not always ſtand upon it, and bring thy <hi>authority</hi> along with thee when thou art to reprove. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and in ſome caſes, a man may bring his <hi>authority</hi> along with him, as <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 2.15. <hi>Rebuke with all authority;</hi> that is, in caſe his <hi>authority</hi> is deſpiſed, and in this ſenſe I take it, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks ſo much of his own <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and rebukes them ſharply for their back-ſliding, becauſe they through the ſecret and ſubtil inſinuations of the falſe Apoſtles, were brought in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to deſpiſe <hi>Pauls</hi> authority; but always a man is not to do ſo, ſee in what a milde and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning way <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.1. he is loath to uſe his <hi>authority,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a milde way beſeecheth them that hee might overcome them that way, and not bee put upon it to uſe his <hi>authority.</hi> So again, Chap. 13.10. hee gives this as a rule to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 6.1. ſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25.</p>
               <p>Again, if thou art (the caſe requiring it) to rebuke with <hi>ſharpneſs,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> if he came and found them in ſuch ways they were in, he muſt uſe <hi>ſharpneſs;</hi> then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to carry thy ſelf that it may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that thy <hi>ſharpneſs,</hi> it is not the wrath of man, but a <hi>true zeal of God.</hi> This wee may ſee
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93048:136"/>in <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 13.1, 2. verſes, compared with 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Again, let it appear unto them, that thou haſt a heart as well <hi>ſenſible of their evil,</hi> and to mourn over the ſame, as a <hi>tongue to reprove them</hi> for it; how ſenſible <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit did uſe to be when hee was to <hi>reprove,</hi> you may ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20.21.</p>
               <p>Again, let it appear that thy deſign is not <hi>their trouble,</hi> or the deſtruction of their peace, but <hi>their good,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian edification,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.19. &amp; chap. 13.10. though it is a hard thing to make a man <hi>ſenſible</hi> in reproving, that his good, and nothing elſe is aimed at, yet if once that bee attained, then is the <hi>reproof</hi> likely to prove effectual.</p>
               <p>Again, do not make reproof a <hi>common cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary thing,</hi> to reprove a man for every thing, and every trifle, this will hinder the fruit of it upon the heart of him whom thou reproveſt.</p>
               <p>Again, reprove <hi>private offences privately, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like publikely;</hi> do not reprove every <hi>private of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> in publike, that man which would thank thee for a reproof <hi>in private,</hi> may ſpeak evil of thee for thy reproof in publike, yet if an offence be <hi>publike,</hi> it muſt be reproved <hi>publikely,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.20. Gal. 2.14.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>for the time</hi> forbear thy reproof, whilſt a man by ſome preſent diſtemper of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c. is <hi>uncapable to receive good</hi> thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walk wiſely</hi> in reſpect of thy <hi>knowledge and practice in leſſer matters;</hi> if thou haſt more light in ſome things than thy brother hath, and thou canſt not <hi>practiſe</hi> thine own <hi>knowledge</hi> without offence to thy brother, forbear thy

                  <hi>practiſe,</hi> Rom. 14.20, 21, 22. 1 Cor. 8.9. to the end, and Chap. 10.28, 29. yet here take this caution, if it <hi>be not weakneſs</hi> which is the cauſe why thy brother ſtumbles, but <hi>wilfulneſs,</hi> and obſtinacy, then it is thy duty to <hi>practiſe, Gal.</hi> 2.</p>

Whilſt the Diſciples were unacquainted with <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit, they were affraid to own him into their company, though he aſſayed to joyn with them; but when by <hi>Barnabas</hi> his relation, they underſtood ſomething of his ſpirit, and the work of God thereupon, <hi>Paul</hi> and they ſweetly clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:

               <p>Doct. 2. <hi>An offending perſon doth not only da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage himſelf, but doth alſo wonderfully damage others.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My intent here is not to handle the common place or ſcandal, or <hi>offence,</hi> my Text having narrowed me up into too ſmall a roome for ſuch a deſign, but only to ſpeak of <hi>offence,</hi> as the ſame hath an influence upon the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>men of the world,</hi> and that for the drawing down of <hi>woe</hi> and judgement upon them, and ſo in the carrying on my Doctrine, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1 What <hi>an offence is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 That <hi>there is an aptneſs</hi> in the world to be <hi>offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That <hi>offences</hi> are a judgement, <hi>a real and heavie judgement</hi> upon the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Why do <hi>offences fall as a judgement</hi> upon the world?</p>
               <p n="5">5 When do Chriſtians <hi>juſtly offend</hi> the work?</p>
               <p>Firſt, What an offence is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> An offence is <hi>that by which another is ſtumbled, or which hath in it a tendency to ſtumble another, as that which he ought not, and it is ſin in him to be ſtumbled at;</hi> as at the ways, works, cauſe truths, promiſe, people of God; when a thing or action doth really <hi>ſtumble,</hi> or miniſter occaſion of <hi>ſtumbling</hi> to another, as touching theſe, or any of theſe, that may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>an offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence in Scripture, a <hi>ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> a <hi>rock of offence,</hi> are joyned together as ſynonimous expreſſions, whereof the one doth but open the other, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32, 33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:93048:144"/>
               <p>Chriſts poverty and meaneneſs was a <hi>ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-block</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the way of their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him, and their <hi>fall</hi> upon this is called, a being <hi>offended,</hi> Mat. 13.57.</p>
               <p>The preaching of a Crucified Chriſt, and Salvation by ſuch a one, was a <hi>great ſtumbling-block</hi> to that people, they could not beleeve that he that was Crucified, and ſhamefully intreated at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was their Meſſiah, for they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that their Meſſiah ſhould bee ſome great Potentate, and that it he did dye (as is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> he is to dye) yet that he ſhould dye a more glorious death; neither could they beleeve that Salvation was attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by this Chriſt, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling block;</hi> Chriſt in this low and ſuffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, was a <hi>ſtumbling block;</hi> now it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that as Chriſt crucified is called a <hi>ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling block,</hi> ſo the Croſs is called <hi>an offence,</hi> Gal. 5.11. the one explaining of the other, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of the other <hi>[then it the offence of the Croſs ceaſed]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>there is an aptneſs in the world to be offended</hi> appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1 They <hi>lye in wait for them,</hi> and therefore <hi>very apt</hi> ſo ſoon as ever <hi>offences</hi> ariſe, to take them up.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>A ſmall thing will offend them;</hi> that man is <hi>apt</hi> to bee <hi>offended</hi> that a little thing <hi>offends,</hi> who will be <hi>offended</hi> at that another eaſily paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth over: now a <hi>little, a very little</hi> thing will <hi>offend</hi> the world; what poor <hi>petty offences</hi> did the Scribes and Phariſees take up againſt Chriſt?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93048:144"/>one while they are <hi>offended,</hi> becauſe hee cureth diſeaſed perſons, another while, becauſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners came to hear him preach; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while, becauſe his Diſciples paſſing through a Corn field plucked a few cars on the Sabbath; another while, becauſe when they went to meat they did not waſh their hands, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there muſt bee <hi>an aptneſs</hi> to bee <hi>offended,</hi> where ſuch <hi>petty</hi> things <hi>offend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 They <hi>will be offended at good;</hi> that man is ſurely <hi>apt</hi> to take <hi>offence</hi> that will bee <hi>offended</hi> at good, which all ought to love, none to be <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> at, but the world will; Chriſt preacheth the Goſpel, a good act, the world are <hi>offended</hi> at that, raiſeth <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his Grave, a bleſſed and glorious act, <hi>offended</hi> at that; <hi>Paul</hi> preached Juſtification, and Salvation by Grace alone, a holy bleſſed doctrine, yet the world are <hi>offended</hi> at that.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If <hi>no offence be given they will make offences ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not be offended;</hi> the Phariſees and Prieſts are <hi>offended</hi> at Chriſt, becauſe he ſaid <hi>deſtroy this temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up,</hi> Joh. 2.19. yet it is clear, they made this <hi>offence,</hi> for they knew his meaning well enough, and ſo ſoon as he was dead they ſpeake it out, <hi>This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver ſaid, after three days I will riſe again,</hi> Mat. 27.63.</p>
               <p n="5">5 They <hi>will take up what may offend them, upon eaſie truſt,</hi> never ſearching the proofe of it, Joh. 7.52. <hi>Search and look, for out of Galilee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth no Prophet,</hi> only the report of the vulgar for this.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That offences are a judgement, a real and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93048:145"/>heavie judgement upon the world; there is a <hi>woe</hi> the world becauſe of theſe, as appears in four or five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>The beauty and glory of the ways, works, truths, people of God, are thus vailed from the eyes of the world; offences</hi> are as a ſcar upon the face, though a face may have much <hi>beauty;</hi> yet if there be a ſcar or ſcars upon it, that obſcures the <hi>beauty</hi> to the eyes of the beholder, the ways and works of God have <hi>abundance of beauty,</hi> but now <hi>offences</hi> of the Saints are as ſcars upon the face of Gods workings, ways, &amp;c. by which the <hi>beauty</hi> of theſe is obſcured to the eyes of the world.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>offended</hi> at Chriſt, and the <hi>beauty and glory</hi> of all his works, his preaching, walking, working Miracles, &amp;c. was hidden to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>By theſe, miſ-apprehenſions of the ways, truths, people of God, yea contrary to thoſe common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions that ſometimes they have had of theſe, are begotten in them.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees could not be without <hi>convictions</hi> ſometimes, and ſtrong too, that Chriſt was that Son of God, that his works were wrought by the power of God, or otherwiſe they could not have been guilty of that ſin againſt the Spirit, which Chriſt chargeth them with; but having drunk in <hi>an offence,</hi> what ſtrange thoughts have they of Chriſt, contrary to former thoughts and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,</hi> they judge him who was faithfulneſs it ſelf, to bee a deluder, a deceiver; who was holineſs of ſelf, to be a friend to, and Patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer of Publicans and Sinners; who was God
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93048:145"/>himſelf, to be Beelzebub the Prince of Devils; his Works, which were wrought by the Finger of God, to be Diabolical: ſo wonderfully did <hi>an offence</hi> drunk in, upon every occaſion work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p>In like manner, wicked men cannot but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee a beauty in Gods ways, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in ſpite of their hearts tells them, and will make them ſometimes confeſs that they are good ways, and the beſt ways; but now when <hi>an offence</hi> lies before them, ſome palpable <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> by which an occaſion of ſtumbling is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, how are their thoughts and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods ways and people altered, they look upon them as the worſt ways in the world, the moſt deceitful people in the world, &amp;c. now what greater <hi>judgement</hi> can befall a man than to be blinded in the things of God? it was the puniſhment of the <hi>Jews</hi> for that horrid Sin of theirs in Crucifying the Lord of Life, <hi>Romans</hi> 11.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>By theſe they bear, and fence off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the blow of the Word, and of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidences;</hi> if at any time the <hi>Word</hi> come cloſe to a poor Sinner, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> chargeth him home with his prophane and ſcandalous living, if he can but ſay this to himſelf, Why are there not ſuch and ſuch of great Profeſſions that doe as I doe, live as I live, are as bad as I am? a man will ſo ſhrowd and ſhelter himſelf under this, that though the <hi>Word</hi> come ever ſo cloſe to him, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> charge ever ſo home, yee neither ſhall reach him, hee lies in this opinion as in a Bulwark, and from it repells whatever
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93048:146"/>aſſaults are made upon him. Now, what a <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgement</hi> is it for a man to bee <hi>Word</hi>-proof, Sermon-proof, <hi>Conſcience</hi>-proof, that neither the <hi>Word,</hi> nor his <hi>Conſcience</hi> can reach him, yet (as woful and common experience teacheth) thus it befalls poor Sinners in the world through <hi>offences; offences</hi> falling upon their hearts, makes their hearts ſo brawny and hard that nothing will pierce them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>By theſe they are emboldned to a neglect of, and an oppoſition unto thoſe very things whereupon their eternal Salvation depends.</hi> A <hi>neglect</hi> of Chriſt, and an <hi>oppoſing</hi> heart to the things of Chriſt, is the general Diſeaſe of the World; yet you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, where the <hi>Word</hi> is powerfully preached, and men ſit under it, there men guilty of ſuch <hi>neglects,</hi> do oft under the ſame meet with gripes, and throbs, &amp;c. and though they have an <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> heart in them, yet from the convincement they have of the goodneſs of the ways of God which they ſee, and hear diſcovered, and the badneſs of their own, they durſt not for their ears, break forth into <hi>open oppoſition;</hi> but now when <hi>offences</hi> ariſe, then they are <hi>emboldned</hi> to a <hi>neglect</hi> of the moſt concerning things, for now think they, ſurely there is not that neceſſity of theſe and theſe things as wee have thought, and are made to beleeve; for were there, certainly ſuch as follow after them would never doe thus and thus, or if the worſt come, we ſhall ſpeed as well as they, and from ſuch a conceit drunk in; now they are bold (who before durſt not) to ſcoff at, and <hi>oppoſe</hi> the things of Chriſt, and their own ſalvation, now what a ſad and heavie
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93048:146"/>
                  <hi>judgement</hi> is this, for a man or woman to bee made <hi>bold</hi> in <hi>neglecting</hi> Chriſt and ſalvation, <hi>bold</hi> in <hi>oppoſing</hi> the means of Grace, that now hee can do it without fear or remorſe? this comes in upon the world by <hi>Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>By theſe they are confirmed and hardned in their own wayes of ſin.</hi> Nothing doth more <hi>confirm,</hi> and ſettle a man in his <hi>own way</hi> and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whatſoever the ſame bee, than this, to ſet a man of a contrary way, or opinion, to come up to his; Now, when the ſinners of the world ſee the Saints of God coming up to their waies, now they begin to think well of their <hi>own wayes,</hi> which perhaps before they were ſuſpicious of, and to applaud them as the only wayes; for ſay they, Do you not ſee that ſuch and ſuch who would ſeem to walk in contrary wayes, yet come up to us? what need wee doubt of <hi>our wayes,</hi> or call them in queſtion, when as they themſelves that ſpeak againſt them, and would ſeem to walk in contrary wayes, yet come and walk in them? were not <hi>our wayes</hi> good wayes, they would not. The prophane Drunkard, when a man of profeſſion will come into the Alehouſe, and there ſit, and bowſe and tipple it with him; certainly ſaith hee, My way is a good way. Now what a <hi>fearful judgement</hi> is this upon a man, when a man is in the high way to hell, and riding gallop thither, and yet is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his way,</hi> that it is a good way, that all the world cannot perſwade him out of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And laſtly, <hi>By theſe the world are brought to blaſpheme the good and right wayes of God:</hi> as they are hereby <hi>confirmed</hi> in their <hi>own
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93048:147"/>wayes,</hi> ſo alſo they come to <hi>blaſpheme Gods wyes;</hi> for, laying the fault of thoſe that walk in it upon the way, they call <hi>Gods wayes</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful way, a hypocritical way; a way that makes thoſe that walk in it, hypocrites and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers; Thus the duſt and dirt that ſome mens corruptions who walk in <hi>Gods way</hi> raiſe, the world in a <hi>blaſphemous way</hi> retort the ſame upon the way of God. Therefore after <hi>Davids</hi> fall, <hi>Nathan</hi> comes to him, and tells him, <hi>That by this, hee had given occaſion to the Enemies of God to blaſpheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what a <hi>ſore judgement</hi> is this upon a man, when he is arrived to that height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, as to throw the dirt and mire of mens corruptions in the face of God himſelf, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>ſpotleſs wayes,</hi> yet this, poor ſinners are brought to by <hi>Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lay all together, and ſee what a <hi>heavy wofull judgement OFFENCES</hi> are upon the world, well might Chriſt ſay, <hi>Wo to the world.</hi> It is ſaid; Rev. 12.12. <hi>Wo to the Inhabitants of the earth, for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath.</hi> So I may ſay when <hi>Offences</hi> ariſe, <hi>Wo, Wo,</hi> to the men of the world, for the Devil is come down among them, the Devil hands abroad <hi>Offences,</hi> hee makes wonderfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, they are his weapons and poyſoned arrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 But why do <hi>Offences</hi> fall as a reall and heavy judgement upon the world?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>God would powre out his wrath upon the obſtinate ſinners of the world, all

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>by theſe they might fill up the meaſure of their iniquity.</hi> God hath a <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of wrath filled up, running over to bee powred upon the ungodly of the world one day; and they have a <hi>meaſure</hi> of iniquity, which they go on filling up here, and by how much this <hi>meaſure</hi> of iniquity is filled up, by ſo much doth the <hi>meaſure</hi> of wrath grow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe ſinners delight to be <hi>filling up</hi> this <hi>meaſure,</hi> therefore they ſhall not want oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but even God himſelf (that ſo the <hi>meaſure</hi> of his wrath may bee filled to the brim) will lay occaſion before them, by leaving his people and permitting them to fall, that ſo the ſinners of the world thereby may be blinded, hardned, made more notoriouſly vile, and ſo have the <hi>meaſure</hi> of their iniquity, <hi>filled up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is obſervable, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 11.6. that God rains <hi>ſnares firſt</hi> upon the wicked, then <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>brimſtone,</hi> and a <hi>horrible tempeſt.</hi> God hath <hi>fire</hi> — Aye, but firſt God will <hi>rain ſnares,</hi> the Drunkard, Adulterer, Swearer, ſhall have ſuch a thing laid as a <hi>ſnare</hi> before him, to harden
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93048:148"/>him, make him more vile, notorious, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible in his ſin.</p>
               <p>O ſinners, ſinners, take heed that now whilſt God is <hi>raining ſnares,</hi> you bee not taken in them, leſt Gods <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>brimſtone,</hi> and <hi>horrible tempeſt</hi> fall upon your heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Becauſe <hi>it is a matter of wonderful juſtice, and equity that when Offences do ariſe, they ſhould fall as a real and heavy judgement upon the world.</hi> Why? why becauſe the world without any reſpect, to the diſhonour that God ſuffers by them, or the reproach of his Name and Cauſe — <hi>Watch for Offences,</hi> wiſh for them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them, rejoyce in them, publiſh and ſpread them; and therefore it is a <hi>moſt juſt</hi> thing with God, that when they come, they ſhould fall as a <hi>judgement</hi> upon them rather than any; This is that they would have, and therefore let them take them, and the <hi>Wo</hi> of them, Drunkard, Swearer, formal Profeſſor, thou wouldeſt have <hi>Offences</hi> ariſe, they are meat and drink to thee. Lo ſaith God, here they are, take them, and the <hi>Wo</hi> of them, for it is thine, thou haſt longed to ſee them, here they are, thou ſhalt have thy belly full of them in the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. Becauſe <hi>God, as in all other things, ſo alſo in the very riſe and iſſue of Offences, would put a manifeſt difference betwixt his own children, and the men of the world: Offences</hi> come to both, but not to both alike: <hi>Offences</hi> to the godly, they are as the <hi>rod</hi> of a Father for <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> to the world as the <hi>rod</hi> of an Enemy for <hi>deſtruction.</hi> To the godly they bring <hi>honey</hi> in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93048:148"/>the tayl of them, to the world a poyſonous deadly <hi>ſting,</hi> a manifeſt difference; To the one, they are <hi>ſeeming judgements,</hi> but <hi>real mercies,</hi> to the other, they are <hi>ſeeming approbations</hi> of their wayes and courſes, but <hi>real judgements</hi> upon their perſons, ſoul and body, for ever, if God prevent not.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But if ſuch a <hi>Woe</hi> come upon the world by <hi>Offences,</hi> How may I come to know (that ſo it may bee prevented) when the world is <hi>juſtly offended,</hi> and ſo <hi>offended</hi> as thereby in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this <hi>dreadful Wo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The world is <hi>juſtly offended when Profeſſors by principles which they hold or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, do put out the light of Nature;</hi> for the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> is a <hi>light</hi> that the Heathens have <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. and poſſibly a meer natural man that hath no work of grace upon his heart, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſpiritual things, as ſpiritual, may ſee thoſe things that this <hi>light</hi> directs too, as clearly as Chriſtians; For, though wicked men are blinde in ſpiritual things, and it may be do not do what natural <hi>light</hi> teacheth; yet are they not ſo blinde, but they can ſee this, they ſhould do.</p>
               <p>Now when Profeſſors maintain <hi>principles</hi> contrary to this <hi>light,</hi> the world who have the <hi>light,</hi> and ſee by it (and ſo far as they ſee, you muſt give them leave to know) are <hi>juſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi> and can tell them to their teeth, their <hi>principles</hi> are a lye, and themſelves a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of liars and deceivers. As to inſtance, Suppoſe a Profeſſor hath ſuch a <hi>principle,</hi> that there is <hi>no God, but onely that God that is within,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93048:149"/>him;</hi> A wicked man, by the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> will tell ſuch a looſe Profeſſor, ſuch an Atheiſt I ſhould ſay, that his <hi>principle</hi> is a lye, and hee is a liar, for when hee beholds the creatures, and things that are made, the <hi>light of Nature</hi> dictates to him, that hee could never make it, and that therefore there muſt bee an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power by which theſe things were made, are ordered and governed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, If a Profeſſor maintain ſuch a <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> that there is <hi>no need of prayer, &amp;c.</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God in ſuch a way, the <hi>light of Nature</hi> will tell him that it is a lye, for the <hi>light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> teacheth this, That God is to bee worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſerved, called upon.</p>
               <p>Again, if a man, a profeſſing man, one that ſeems to hold ſuch a <hi>principle,</hi> that I need make <hi>no conſcience of any ſin,</hi> or action whatſoever, I may bee drunk, or murther my neighbour, lye with his wife, the <hi>light of Nature</hi> will teach ſuch a one, that this <hi>principle</hi> is a damnable lye, and he is a liar, for the <hi>light of Nature</hi> diſcovers theſe horrid works of darkneſs, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates theſe.</p>
               <p>Now when men by their <hi>principles,</hi> extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and <hi>blot out the light of Nature,</hi> then is the world <hi>juſtly offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When Profeſſors in their practices ſwerve from the rules of morality.</hi> The moral Law was written in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, and therefore it is written in the nature of every man: So that by this, men of the world are able to paſs a judgement upon moral acts, whether they be good or bad; though wicked men
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93048:149"/>cannot judge of the faith of the godly, nor of his works as they are the fruit of his faith, yet they can judge of his morality, and of his acts as they are moral acts.</p>
               <p>Now when men of the world ſee Profeſſors break the <hi>pales and bonds of morality,</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs theſe rules they are <hi>juſtly offended,</hi> and know, that they do evill, though all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in the world ſhould ſay the contrary, their profeſſion weighs nothing with them, but is the <hi>greater offence</hi> to them by how much the more they profeſs, when by this their Profeſſion they think to bear out themſelves in the violation of thoſe Laws, which are by nature ingraven in their hearts, and they know as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As to give inſtance, it is one of <hi>Natures Laws</hi> that a man ſhould be <hi>juſt, honeſt,</hi> and <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> in his dealings betwixt man and man; Now when a Profeſſor ſhall <hi>ſhuffle,</hi> and <hi>equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> and ſay, and unſay, have no regard to truth; civil equity or juſtice in words or deeds, the world is <hi>juſtly offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Temperance</hi> is a <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which though worldly men obſerve not in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, yet they know intemperance is a ſin; Now when a Profeſſor will ſit by the hour together, and blowſe it, the world is <hi>juſtly offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Modeſty</hi> is a <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> now when a Profeſſor ſhall bee either in apparrel, going, geſtures, or ſpeeches, ſo light as that there is an apparent ſhew of <hi>immodeſty,</hi> the world is <hi>juſtly offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>When Profeſſors in their whole converſation are like to the world, and ſingular
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93048:150"/>only in profeſſion;</hi> for obſerve it, when a man by his <hi>profeſſion</hi> gives it out, that hee diſlikes the ways of the world, and is a Subject in another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the world doth now expect to ſee <hi>ſingular ſpeeches,</hi> and <hi>carriages,</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> in him, and that his walk ſhould be according to that which he would be accounted to bee; now when the would ſees this man, which gives it out hee is ſuch a one, to ſhape his ſpeeches, ways, courſes, actions, by the Laws and cuſtoms of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when he talks as they talk, and walks as they walk, and acts as they act, is in all things as farre as they can diſcern, one with them, only in profeſſion, and would be another from them, they are <hi>juſtly offended,</hi> and count him, and ſuch as he is, a company of Impoſtors, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers; for though the world cannot judge of the Laws, and Cuſtoms of the Kingdom of God, which theſe profeſs they relate unto, yet they are ſo well skilled in the Laws, and Cuſtoms, and ways and Faſhions of their own Kingdome, that they can tell when a man walks with them, though they love not ſavoury ſpeech, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſe, yet they judge by what theſe men <hi>profeſs,</hi> that they ſhould have ſuch, though themſelves will ſwear, and lye, and raile, yet they think theſe ſhould not doe ſo, and though they count it no great matter in themſelves to Card and Dice, to Lye, and Cozen, and Cheat, and be Drunk, and Whore, &amp;c. yet they think it is in them; now I ſay, when the world view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſſors, ſee them in their whole converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like them, and can ſee no difference at all, only they <hi>profeſſ,</hi> and we do not, they are <hi>offended,</hi> and that <hi>juſtly.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:93048:150"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Is it ſo, that there is a woe upon the world becauſe of offences? <hi>then all things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the world hath little cauſe to rejoyce, and make themſelves merry with the falls and offences of the godly;</hi> the <hi>falls</hi> of good men are the Saints <hi>ſhame,</hi> but they are the worlds <hi>woe;</hi> thou calleſt thy companions together, O I can tell you ſtory, have you not heard it? Such an one, of ſo great profeſſion, of ſuch a way, hath done thus and thus; but hearken man, Ile tell thee a ſtory, haſt thou not heard it? Chriſt when he was here on earth cried out, <hi>Woe unto the world becauſe of offences;</hi> WOE to the Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and mocker becauſe of <hi>offences,</hi> for he ſhall be hardned by them; WOE to the Drunkard, the Swearer, becauſe of <hi>offences;</hi> WOE to the formal Profeſſor, for he ſhall be lulled aſleep in his formal way by them; O WOE, <hi>WOE to the world becauſe of offences.</hi> The world is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nearer the WOE, than when they think themſelves furtheſt from it; when by the <hi>falls</hi> of Profeſſors, they are hardned in their way, and bleſs themſelves in their wickedneſs, and think they are right, then is the WOE dropping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads: Haſt thou therefore been ſuch a one, or haſt thou a heart that delighteſt in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thy Companions, to make it a part of thy ribald talk, to lay open, enlarge, and laugh at the miſcarriages of godly men? O man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, quake and tremble now before the Lord, leaſt this <hi>dreadful woe</hi> fall upon thy head, <hi>WOE to the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Firſt, put caſe I have been, am ſuch a one, is there no way to eſcape this woe, or if there
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93048:151"/>be, how may I eſcape it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Get clear of the world;</hi> the WO is upon the <hi>world,</hi> and ſo long as thou art not clear of the <hi>world,</hi> thou canſt not be out of the reach of this WO, it will fall upon thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Mourn for offences, when thou ſeeſt them ariſe:</hi> he that <hi>mourns for offences</hi> when they ariſe, ſhall not come under the WO of <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> thoſe that <hi>mourned</hi> for the abominations of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had a <hi>mark of deliverance</hi> ſet upon them in the day of its deſolation; thoſe that <hi>mourn for offences</hi> when they ariſe, ſhall have a <hi>mark of deliverance</hi> ſet upon them, from the WOE of <hi>offences,</hi> when the ſame ſhall fall on the <hi>world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Adjudge thy ſelf for it, as if thou hadſt done it;</hi> ſay, Lord, ſuch a one hath fallen, but behold, here's the Traytor, here's the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, for ought I know, my Drunkenneſs, my Scoffing, and Sabbath-breaking, may bee the cauſe, why ſuch a one is left thus to fall, it may be to harden ſuch a wretch as I am, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Get, and maintain honourable thoughts of Gods ways, though the miſcarriages of thoſe that walk in them, may bee many and very foul;</hi> the thing which proves the undoing of poor ſinners is this, they throw the dung of Profeſſors upon the ways of God, and by ſo doing, their hearts are every day ſet more off from Gods ways, and more hardned in their own ways of ſin, and this draws the WO up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; wouldeſt thou eſcape this WO? then maintains <hi>honourable thoughts</hi> of Gods ways.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:93048:151"/>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Is it ſo, that there is a <hi>wo</hi> unto the world becauſe of <hi>offences?

                     <item>2 That it is a <hi>bleſſed thing,</hi> for a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to get over this evil.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Either of theſe will afford us many neceſſary Queſtions; but I ſhall not ſtrictly tye up my ſelf to either: but I have fixed upon this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſpeak ſomewhat to the ſubject of <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi> more in general, as it is a <hi>caſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>OFFENCE is two-fold, either <hi>offence given,</hi> or <hi>offence</hi> taken; <hi>Offence given,</hi> is, when by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tranſ-acted, done? or ſpoken, <hi>an occaſion of ſtumbling,</hi> and being offended, is laid before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: An <hi>offence taken,</hi> is, when at the <hi>occaſion of the offence,</hi> the other is offended.</p>
                  <p>Of either of theſe, there is an offence, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 There is a <hi>GOOD offence given,</hi> and a <hi>BAD offence given:</hi>

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:93048:154"/>
                  <p n="1">1 A <hi>GOOD offence given,</hi> is that <hi>offence</hi> which hath <hi>no evil</hi> in it, in reſpect of the <hi>Giver,</hi> though yet it proves an <hi>offence</hi> to ſome, and this is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 When <hi>by inſtructing of the weak in things neceſſary to be known, I doe offend the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> Thus Chriſt <hi>offended</hi> the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.10, 11, 12. <hi>Hear and underſtand; not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. Then came his Diſciples and ſaid unto him, knoweſt thou that the Phariſees were offended after they heard this ſaying?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 When <hi>by maintaining of my Chriſtian liberty againſt thoſe who would infringe it, I doe offend the obstinate.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. the beginning.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When <hi>by the light of Chriſtian Doctrine and converſation, I doe offend the world, by diſcovering and deſtroying their deeds of darkneſs:</hi> thus the Apoſtles when they went forth with the Goſpel, did in all places <hi>offend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 VVhen <hi>by following of God in ſomewhat which I am really convinced is my duty, yet dark to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I do offend that other.</hi> Thus <hi>Peter by going unto</hi> Cornelius's <hi>houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 A <hi>BAD offence given,</hi> is, when an <hi>offence hath evil</hi> in it in reſpect of the <hi>Giver,</hi> which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="1">1 VVhen <hi>by compliance with ſome that are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, I do endanger the faith of ſuch who are free from ſuperſtition, and not addicted to it.</hi> Thus <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 2. by compliance with ſuperſtitious Jews, endangered the faith of the Gentiles who were free from ſuperſtition. verſ. 11. <hi>But when</hi> Peter <hi>was come to</hi> Antioch, <hi>I withſtood him to the

                  </p>
                  <p>If I muſt <hi>offend,</hi> let me ever <hi>offend</hi> the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, rather then by <hi>offending,</hi> endanger thoſe who are free.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 VVhen <hi>by an unadviſed uſing my Chriſtian liberty, I do offend the weak that cannot bear it;</hi> thus rather then <hi>Paul</hi> would <hi>offend,</hi> hee would eat no fleſh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If meat make my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leaſt I make my brother to offend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 VVhen <hi>by extravagancy of words or actions, I do offend the world,</hi> and ſtumble them at the ways of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>Offence taken,</hi> is likewiſe two-fold; A <hi>GOOD offence</hi> taken or <hi>BAD;</hi> a <hi>GOOD,</hi> is that, which though in reſpect of the <hi>thing it ſelf</hi> it may be <hi>evil,</hi> yet hath <hi>no evil</hi> in it, but is good in reſpect of <hi>the Taker;</hi> A <hi>BAD</hi> is that, which although the <hi>thing it ſelf</hi> may bee <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> ſometimes one, ſometimes another, yet is <hi>ever bad</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Taker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 A GOOD <hi>offence</hi> taken, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 VVhen <hi>I am offended at that whereat God is offended, the faith or ſalvation of another endangered, meerly becauſe God is offended.</hi> This
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93048:155"/>is that anger without ſin <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26. thus <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>offended</hi> at <hi>Peter,</hi> Galat. 2. verſ. 11.12.14. becauſe hee did not only ſin againſt God, but alſo endanger the faith and Salvation of weak Gentiles, by his Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 VVhen <hi>I am offended at the love of a good man, when his love towards mee is carnal, and tends to hinder mee in ſome work or deſign for God, which I have in hand.</hi> Thus Chriſt was <hi>offended</hi> at <hi>Peters</hi> love, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22, 23. — <hi>Be it farre from thee, Lord — But hee turned, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me, for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 A <hi>BAD offence</hi> taken, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 VVhen <hi>I am offended at the grace of God to others, becauſe it caſts ſome diſgrace upon my ſelf.</hi> Thus <hi>Jonah</hi> took <hi>offence</hi> at Gods grace to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi> becauſe he ſhould bee called a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 VVhen <hi>I am offended at the apparent works of God, becauſe I am laid by, and not I, but others uſed in the doing of them.</hi> Thus the Scribes and Phariſees did take <hi>offence</hi> at Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 VVhen <hi>through a careleſs neglect, I take up that as an offence, which by induſtry and ſearch of Scriptures, would be a ſtrengthening to my faith.</hi> Thus becauſe the Meſſiah was to bee of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi> at Chriſt, becauſe he was of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> (as they thought) whereas by ſearch in their Genealogy, they might, to their confirming, have found him of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> houſe.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:93048:155"/>
                  <p n="4">4 VVhen <hi>I am offended at the ſin committed,</hi> becauſe of the perſon that commits it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 VVhen <hi>I am offended at the wayes, and truthes of God, becauſe of the miſcarriages</hi> of ſome walking in thoſe wayes, profeſſing thoſe truths.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 1. <hi>How farre am I to have reſpect to that offence which another doth, or will take?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a double riſe of <hi>offence</hi> taken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Sometimes from <hi>weakneſs only,</hi> and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sometimes from <hi>wilfulneſs only,</hi> or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wilfulnes <hi>mixt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt, I am to have ſome <hi>reſpect to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offence;</hi> whether the riſe bee from <hi>want of light,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> in circumciſing <hi>Titus</hi> had reſpect to the <hi>offence,</hi> that otherwiſe the <hi>Jews</hi> would take, through <hi>want of light;</hi> or whether it riſeth from <hi>weakneſs of grace,</hi> or from ſome violent, and apparent temptation upon him at preſent.</p>
                  <p>In the latter, I am to <hi>ſlight</hi> it, as though there were no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may we know when the riſe of an</hi> offence <hi>is from wilfulneſs only, or from weakneſs and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs together?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>When there is ſuch a proneneſs to take</hi> offence, <hi>as that very thing offends.</hi> This diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>offence</hi> of the Scribes and Phariſees to be <hi>wilful,</hi> becauſe it was ſo common with them to be <hi>offended</hi> at Chriſt, that Chriſt can do nothing, but they are <hi>offended</hi> at it; one while they are <hi>offended,</hi> becauſe hee cured a man on the Sabbath
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93048:156"/>day, another while becauſe he did eat with Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>When ſmall petty things offend,</hi> thus the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful offended</hi> Phariſees are <hi>offended,</hi> one while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſts Diſciples plucked ears of Corn, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, becauſe when they went to meat, they did not waſh their hands, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When offence is taken even <hi>at that which is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 When the very ſame thing that is <hi>well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of in ſome, in others offends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>When there is a management of the offence in a crafty way, ſo as to draw the Party offended, into ſome ſnare;</hi> by this <hi>Paul</hi> diſcerned their <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> to be a <hi>wilful offence,</hi> Galath. 2. verſ. 3, 4. <hi>But neither</hi> Titus <hi>who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to bee circumciſed, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of falſe Brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to ſpy out our liberty, which wee have in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>When men will put ſuch an interpretation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thing, as may either beget or nouriſh an offence,</hi> when as yet they know how to put another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation upon that thing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 When men will take up whatſoever may offend them, <hi>upon eaſie truſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 When men <hi>lye at a catch,</hi> for ſomewhat which may offend them.</p>
                  <p>In caſes of this nature, I am <hi>not to regard</hi> the <hi>offence</hi> of others, but as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. v. 14. <hi>Let them alone,</hi> — So let them bee <hi>offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> if they will.</p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:93048:156"/>
                  <p>Caſe 2. <hi>What is to bee done, when the Caſe is ſuch, that I muſt offend on the one hand or the other? or thus, when the Caſe is ſuch that I ſtand between two parties contrary to each other, and muſt offend the one of them, whom am I in this Caſe to chooſe to offend?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Caſe is the very ſame caſe that was <hi>Pauls,</hi> Gal. 2. hee was caſt betwixt two ſorts of men, and obſerve the perſons too, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on both hands. The one were <hi>Jews</hi> who were ſcrupulous about Ceremonies, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly whether or no it were lawful to eat meat with the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> The other were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who being through the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> rightly grounded and ſettled in the faith of the Goſpel, had no ſuch ſcruples among them.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe two, hee muſt <hi>offend one,</hi> as the caſe lay thus. If with <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt hee would not withdraw, hee muſt of neceſſity <hi>offend</hi> the ſcrupulous brethren come down from <hi>Judea:</hi> If on the other ſide hee did, then by this act hee plainly foreſaw hee ſhould <hi>endanger the faith</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> hereby cauſing them to think ſuch Ceremonial obſervations were things neceſſary, and ſo indeed compell the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> i. e. by ſuch an example (as hee ſaith to <hi>Peter</hi>) to live as did the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>What doth</hi> Paul <hi>in this caſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why notwithſtanding the temptation was ſo great, that hee ſaw of neceſſity there was no avoyding of it, but that ſhould hee now comply a little, the <hi>Jews</hi> would bee in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner irreconcileably <hi>offended;</hi> nay ſo much the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93048:157"/>more would they bee <hi>offended,</hi> and by ſo much the more muſt hee look to paſs under high cenſures, by how much <hi>Peter</hi> the Pillar of the Church, hee complies and conforms; yea <hi>Barnabas, Pauls</hi> companion, hee doth too, verſ. 13. and all the reſt; So that <hi>Paul,</hi> if hee will not comply too, hee muſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from all, and run the cenſure of all.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, <hi>Paul</hi> conſiders, that there were a company of poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> to whom hee had rightly preached the faith of Chriſt, from which doctrine they had received the peace and comfort of the Holy Ghoſt; and hee conſiders further, that in caſe hee ſhould now comply with theſe <hi>Jews</hi> to win them, hee ſhould thereby <hi>ſhake the faith and comfort</hi> of the other; theſe things conſidered, hee oppoſeth himſelf to this compliance, and publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, that Pillar of the Church, and the head of the Compliers, verſ. 11, 12, 14.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, the example clearly proves this; <hi>That a publick compliance, to the ſhaking, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the faith or comfort of any, deſerves a publick reproof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from this inſtance of <hi>Paul,</hi> I give in my anſwer to the caſe propounded, thus. <hi>That when the caſe is ſuch, that I muſt of neceſſity offend one party, I am to chooſe to offend them, bee they the ſtrong, or be they the weake, whom I cannot pleaſe without an endangering of the faith and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſome others, in endeavouring to doe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, by <hi>endangering the faith and comfort
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93048:157"/>of others;</hi> I mean thus, When others are ſettled and confirmed in <hi>ſuch principles,</hi> whether they bee in things of Doctrine or Diſcipline, as I am perſwaded are the truths of Chriſt, and ſuch truths too, as are of uſe and benefit to the people of God, by which they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to walk more cloſely with God, been more ſtrengthned to reſiſt temptation, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, been made more uſeful to the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one another, have had their communion with God increaſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When by a compliance with any other, to win them, I ſhall <hi>ſhake theſe</hi> in their <hi>principles,</hi> I am then guilty or <hi>endangering the faith and comfort of others;</hi> And when the caſe is ſuch, I am bound, and it is a neceſſary duty to <hi>offend,</hi> yea though it bee all the world, rather than in the leaſt, to <hi>endanger the faith and comfort</hi> of any one ſoul.</p>
                  <p>This caſe I have opened, clearly ſhews, that the <hi>weak brother</hi> is not alwayes to bee <hi>pleaſed,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrong offended;</hi> for as it is clear from <hi>Paul,</hi> thoſe who made ſuch ſcruples, were alwayes the <hi>weake,</hi> yet here, rather than <hi>Paul</hi> will <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the faith</hi> of the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> hee will chooſe to <hi>offend</hi> the <hi>weake.</hi>
